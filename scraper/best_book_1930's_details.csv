The Hobbit,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).","['Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']"
Brave New World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World,"Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. , his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, d likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites.""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', 'Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook']"
Of Mice and Men,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men,"“I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that's why.”They are an unlikely pair: George is ""small and quick and dark of face""; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a ""family,"" clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing , creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'American', 'Historical']"

The Grapes of Wrath,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', 'American', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'High School']"

Nominally fiction but more rightly called ""creative confessions,"" they told of the author's childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles.

Civilization and Its Discontents,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357636.Civilization_and_Its_Discontents,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.","['Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Sociology', 'Theory', 'Politics', 'History', 'School']"

The Road to Wigan Pier,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30553.The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier,"In the 1930s, commissioned by a left-wing book club, Orwell went to the industrial areas of northern England to investigate and record the real situation of the working class. Orwell did more than just investigate; he went down to the deepest part of the mine, lived in dilapidated and filthy workers' houses, and used the tip of his pen to vividly reveal every aspect of the coal miners' lives. Reading today, 80 years later, Still shockingly true. The despair and poverty conveyed by this picture have a terrifying power that transcends time and national boundaries. At the same time, the Road to Wigan Pier is also Orwell's road to socialism as he examines his own inner self. Born in the British middle class, he recalled how he gradually began to doubt and then hate the strict class barriers that divided British society at that time.

Keep the Aspidistra Flying,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9648.Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying,"London, 1936. Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and ""rather moth-eaten already,"" a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen ""flatter than any pancake,"" Gordon has given up a ""good"" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes), ""If you have no money ... women won't love you."" On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of ""mingy, lower-middle-class decency"" he is fleeing in his downward flight.In , George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls ""the money-world"" in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge, too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself.Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a ""happy"" ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour, but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'British Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'English Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Literary Fiction']"

What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between ""cheap grace"" and ""costly grace."" ""Cheap grace,"" Bonhoeffer wrote, ""is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.""is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.","['Christian', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Discipleship', 'Spirituality', 'Classics']"

And if Bjartur of Summerhouses, the book's protagonist, is an ordinary sheep farmer, his flinty determination to achieve independence is genuinely heroic and, at the same time, terrifying and bleakly comic.Having spent eighteen years in humiliating servitude, Bjartur wants nothing more than to raise his flocks unbeholden to any man. But Bjartur's spirited daughter wants to live unbeholden to . What ensues is a battle of wills that is by turns harsh and touching, elemental in its emotional intensity and intimate in its homely detail. Vast in scope and deeply rewarding, Independent People is simply a masterpiece","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Historical']"

Death in the Afternoon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4648.Death_in_the_Afternoon,"Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and ""the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick."" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Spain', 'Literature', 'Travel', 'Sports', 'American', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'The United States Of America']"

Mephisto,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223635.Mephisto,"Klaus Mann - Thomas Mann’s son - wrote MEPHISTO while living in exile from the Germany of World War II. In it he captures the Isherwood-like atmosphere of Nazi Germany while telling a satiric story about the rise to power of one man - a thinly veiled caricature of his own brother-in-law. The man is Hendrik Hofgen, a character actor who in his own life plays a bizarre part in the elite circle of the Third Reich. Hofgen is publicly a revolutionary, but secretly he is a man driven by an obsessive need for power and fame. Although he benefits from the prestige of being married to the daughter of an eminent politician, he endangers his rise in Nazi society by his compulsive involvement with ‘a black Venus.’ His brilliant success as Mephisto in FAUST brings him the support of the Führer’s prime minister, who appoints him head of the State Theater. His dreams are finally realized, but the story ends on a note of despair as Hofgen is forced to confront the emptiness of his life. Mann weaves his tale with amazing skill. The result is a fascinating novel of decadence and evil.Klaus Mann, the second child of Thomas Mann, was born in Munich in 1906. He began writing short stories and articles in 1924, and within a year was a theatrical critic for a Berlin newspaper. In 1925 both a volume of short stories and his first novel, THE PIOUS DANCE, were published. His sister, Erika, to whom he was very close, was in the cast of his first play, ANJA AND ESTHER. Mann left Germany in 1933 and lived in Amsterdam until 1936, during which time he became a Czechoslovakian citizen, having been deprived of his German citizenship by the Nazis. He moved to America in 1936, living in Princeton, New Jersey, and New York City. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. He died at the age of forty-two in Cannes, France.

The authors made the claim that ""All the History you can remember is in the Book,"" and, for most Brits, they were probably right.

Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov's Laughter in the Dark; this, the author tells us, is the whole story except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterwork as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others.

Nightwood,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53101.Nightwood,"Nightwood, Djuna Barnes' strange and sinuous tour de force, ""belongs to that small class of books that somehow reflect a time or an epoch"" (TLS). That time is the period between the two World Wars, and Barnes' novel unfolds in the decadent shadows of Europe's great cities, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna—a world in which the boundaries of class, religion, and sexuality are bold but surprisingly porous.The outsized characters who inhabit this world are some of the most memorable in all of fiction—there is Guido Volkbein, the Wandering Jew and son of a self-proclaimed baron; Robin Vote, the American expatriate who marries him and then engages in a series of affairs, first with Nora Flood and then with Jenny Petherbridge, driving all of her lovers to distraction with her passion for wandering alone in the night; and there is Dr. Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor, a transvestite and ostensible gynecologist, whose digressive speeches brim with fury, keen insights, and surprising allusions.Barnes' depiction of these characters and their relationships (Nora says, ""A man is another person—a woman is yourself, caught as you turn in panic; on her mouth you kiss your own"") has made the novel a landmark of feminist and lesbian literature. Most striking of all is Barnes' unparalleled stylistic innovation, which led T. S. Eliot to proclaim the book ""so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.""Now with a new preface by Jeanette Winterson, still crackles with the same electric charge it had on its first publication in 1936.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Womens']"

By war's end she had lost virtually everyone she loved. Testament of Youth is both a record of what she lived through and an elegy for a vanished generation.

Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeper and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive ""ism"" about education, even such an ""ism"" as ""progressivism."" His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, one that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.","['Education', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Teaching', 'Psychology', 'School', 'Classics', 'Academic', 'Sociology', 'Grad School']"

Working as a chorus girl, Anna drifts into the demi-monde of Edwardian London.

Her childish dreams have been replaced by the harsher reality of living in a man's world, where all charity has its price.

The long poem was the beginning of Cesaire's quest for negritude, and it became an anthem of Blacks around the world. With its emphasis on unusual juxtapositions of object and metaphor, manipulation of language into puns and neologisms, and rhythm, Cesaire considered his style a ""beneficial madness"" that could ""break into the forbidden"" and reach the powerful and overlooked aspects of black culture.Clayton Eshleman and Annette Smith achieve a laudable adaptation of Cesaire's work to English by clarifying double meanings, stretching syntax, and finding equivalent English puns, all while remaining remarkably true to the French text. Their treatment of the poetry is marked with imagination, vigor, and accuracy that will clarify difficulties for those already familiar with French, and make the work accessible to those who are not. Andre Breton's introduction, A Great Black Poet, situates the text and provides a moving tribute to C saire.is recommended for readers in comparative literature, post-colonial literature, African American studies, poetry, modernism, and French.","['Poetry', 'France', 'Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'School', 'Africa', 'French Literature', 'Literature', '20th Century']"

However, she is also intensely sympathetic to the less fortunate, for example the reader knows that Miss Foddy, the governess to the neighbouring children, faces a bleak future where ‘it is so extremely difficult for a woman of my age and uncertified qualifications to find a post‘ and DE Stevenson never forgets ‘the potentially bleak outlook for women who cannot marry into a secure life.’ Yet despite moments of seriousness, is overall a funny, touching and interesting novel that most Persephone readers will enjoy very much.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Adult', '20th Century']"

Connolly here confronts the evils of domesticity, politics, drink, and advertising as well as novelists such as Joyce, Proust, Hemingway, and Faulkner in essays that remain fresh and penetrating to this day.  “A fine critic, compulsive traveler, and candid autobiographer. . . .

In fact, Lamb was largely responsible for the discovery of Gone With the Wind; after reading Miller's novel, Macmillan editor Harold S. Latham sought other southern novels and authors, and found Margaret Mitchell.Caroline Miller was fascinated by the other Old South—not the romantic inhabitants of Gone With the Wind, but rather the poor people of the south Georgia backwoods, who never owned a slave or planned to fight a war. The story of Cean and Lonzo, a young couple who begin their married lives two decades before the Civil War, Lamb in His Bosom is a fascinating account of social customs and material realities among settlers of the Georgia frontier. At the same time, Lamb in His Bosom transcends regional history as Miller's quietly lyrical prose style pays poignant tribute to a woman's life lived close to nature—the nature outside her and the nature within.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Southern', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'The United States Of America', 'Civil War']"

Abraham Lincoln,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415107.Abraham_Lincoln,"America was at a crossroads in 1939 as they debated whether to join the Allies in their battle against Hitler's relentless march across Europe. As European immigrants the d'Aulaires felt keenly the importance of standing against injustice, and saw in Lincoln the archetypal American hero as he stood against the injustice of slavery. It was this spirit they hoped to exemplify in their biography of young Abe as he grew into manhood against the backdrop of the wilderness of Kentucky, the deep woods of Indiana, and the prairies of Illinois. Camping for weeks in Lincoln country, the d'Aulaires imbibed the spirit of the man Lincoln as well as his humor and good will. From his days as a clerk, teaching himself law reading Blackstone, practicing law in Springfield, running unsuccessfully for office, debating Stephen Douglas over the issue of slavery, and ultimately becoming President of the United States, the d'Aulaires have written and beautifully illustrated the life of one of America's most remarkable citizens. Abraham Lincoln continues to stand as America's most beloved President. The admiration felt by Americans for Lincoln's humble integrity, his noble statesmanship, and his keen sense of justice are beautifully captured in the d'Aulaires' art and prose. As our nation celebrates the Bicentennial of Lincoln's birth, the message of his life, and death, is as timely as ever. Of our nation's historical icons, Lincoln is the quintessential embodiment of American possibility in his mythic-like rise from rail-splitter to Chief Executive and Emancipator of the oppressed. May his story live on.--Rea Berg, Beautiful Feet Books, 2008","['Picture Books', 'Biography', 'History', 'Childrens', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'School', 'Juvenile']"

There now! Start to unravel from there.'Design for Living is a wickedly witty dark romantic comedy by Noel Coward. Initially banned in the UK, this provocative play portrays three amoral, glib and stylish characters and their hopelessly inescapable, if also unconventional, emotional entanglement.From 1930s bohemian Paris to the dizzying heights of Manhattan society, a tempestuous love triangle unravels between a vivacious interior designer, Gilda, playwright Leo and artist Otto - three people unashamedly and passionately in love with each other. They are trapped in what Coward called 'a three-sided erotic hodge podge.'With Coward's trademark piquant style, this lively, funny but also atypical play looks at dazzling, egotistical creatures and their self-destructive dependence on each other. Exploring themes of bisexuality, celebrity, success and self-obsession, is a stylish and scandalous comedy.","['Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'LGBT', 'Humor', '20th Century', 'British Literature', 'Theatre']"

"Living My Life, Vol. 1",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1055914.Living_My_Life_Vol_1,"“You damn bitch of an anarchist, I wish I could get at you. I would tear your heart out and feed it to my dog.” This was one of the less obscene messages received by Emma Goldman (1869-1940), while in jail on suspicion of complicity in the assassination of McKinley. The most notorious woman of her day, she was bitterly hated by millions and equally revered by millions.The strong feelings she aroused are understandable. She was an alien, a practicing anarchist, a labor agitator, a pacifist in World War 1, an advocate of political violence, a feminist, a proponent of free love and birth control, a communist, a street-fighter for justice — all of which she did with strong intellect and boundless passion. Today, of course, many of the issues that she fought over are just as vital as they were then.Emma Goldman came from Russia at the age of 17. After an encounter with the sweatshop and an unfortunate marriage, she plunged into the bewildering intellectual and activist chaos that attended American social evolution around the turn of the twentieth century. She knew practically everyone of importance in radical circles. She dominated many areas of the radical movement, lecturing, writing, haranguing, and publishing to awaken the world to her ideas. After World War I she was deported to Russia, where she soon discovered that anarchists were no better liked than in America, despite Lenin’s first gesture of welcome. She escaped with her life but never was allowed to return to the United States.Emma Goldman was a devastatingly honest woman, who spared herself as little as she spared anyone else. From her account the reader can gain insight into a curious personality type of recurrent interest: a woman who devoted her life to eliminating suffering, yet could make a bomb or assist in staging an assassination. Equally interesting are her comments on other radicals of the period, such as Kropotkin, Berkman, Mooney, Lenin, Trotsky, Haywood, Most, the Haymarket martyrs, and many others. Her autobiography, written with vigor, ranks among the finest in the English language.","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Labor', 'Biography Memoir']"

Dawn’s Early Light is the first novel in the series.            In it, Colonial Williamsburg comes alive. Thane centers her novel around four major the Aristrocratic St. John Sprague, who becomes George Washington’s aide; Regina Greensleeves, a Virginia beauty spoiled by a season in London; Julian Day, a young schoolmaster who arrives from England on the eve of the war and initially thinks of himself as a Tory; and Tibby Mawes, one of his less fortunate pupils, saddled with an alcoholic father and an indigent mother.

We watch the cat-and-mouse game between Cornwallis and Lafayette, which ended in Cornwallis’s unlucky stand at Yorktown.

Gilgi is a secretary in a hosiery firm, but she doesn’t intend to stay there for long: she’s disciplined and ambitious, taking language classes, saving up money to go abroad, and carefully avoiding both the pawing of her boss and any other prolonged romantic entanglements. But then she falls in love with Martin, a charming drifter, and leaves her job for domestic bliss—which turns out not to be all that blissful– and Gilgi finds herself pregnant and facing a number of moral dilemmas.Revolutionary at the time for its treatment of sexual harassment, abortion, single motherhood, and the “New Woman,” remains a perceptive and beautifully constructed novel about one woman’s path to maturity.

Health inspectors called the neighborhood “the suicide ward.” Diarrhea epidemics raged each summer, killing thousands of children. Sweatshop babies with smallpox and typhus dozed in garment heaps destined for fashionable shops. Desperate mothers paced the streets to soothe their feverish children and white mourning cloths hung from every building. A third of the children living there died before their fifth birthday.By 1911, the child death rate had fallen sharply and The New York Times hailed the city as the healthiest on earth. In this witty and highly personal autobiography, public health crusader Dr. S. Josephine Baker explains how this transformation was achieved. By the time she retired in 1923, Baker was famous worldwide for saving the lives of 90,000 children. The programs she developed, many still in use today, have saved the lives of millions more. She fought for women’s suffrage, toured Russia in the 1930s, and captured “Typhoid” Mary Mallon, twice. She was also an astute observer of her times, and Fighting for Life is one of the most honest, compassionate memoirs of American medicine ever written.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Science', 'Health', 'Medical', 'Womens', 'Medicine', 'Autobiography']"

Nancy Mitford skewers her family and their beliefs with her customary jewelled barbs, but there is froth, comedy and heart here too. 'Deliciously funny' Evelyn Waugh Nancy Mitford was the eldest of the infamous Mitford sisters, known for her membership in 'The Bright Young Things' clique of the 1920s and an intimate of Evelyn Waugh; she produced witty, satirical novels with a cast of characters taken directly from the aristocratic social scene of which she was a part. Her novels, The Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate, The Blessing and Don't Tell Alfred, are available in single paperback editions from Penguin or as part of The Penguin Complete Novels of Nancy Mitford which also includes Highland Fling, Christmas Pudding and Pigeon Pie. This edition of Wigs on the Green is introduced by journalist and editor Charlotte Mosley.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Humor', '20th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Comedy', 'Politics', 'Literature']"

Previously available only to a few libraries and collectors, this is a major source and great treat for anyone interested in the surrealists and their work, in collage, visual illusion, dream visions, and the interpretations of dreams.","['Art', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fiction', 'Comics', 'Fantasy', 'France', 'Classics', '20th Century', 'Surreal', 'Art History']"

His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding dread and unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the posthumous tale presented ""The Shunned House.""Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence that he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.","['Horror', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fantasy', 'Lovecraftian', 'Gothic', 'Weird Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Paranormal']"

Dumb Luck,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1362808.Dumb_Luck,"Banned in Vietnam until 1986, Dumb Luck--by the controversial and influential Vietnamese writer Vu Trong Phung--is a bitter satire of the rage for modernization in Vietnam during the late colonial era. First published in Hanoi during 1936, it follows the absurd and unexpected rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named Red-haired Xuan. As it charts Xuan's fantastic social ascent, the novel provides a panoramic view of late colonial urban social order, from the filthy sidewalks of Hanoi's old commercial quarter to the gaudy mansions of the emergent Francophile northern upper classes. The transformation of traditional Vietnamese class and gender relations triggered by the growth of colonial capitalism represents a major theme of the novel.Dumb Luck is the first translation of a major work by Vu Trong Phung, arguably the greatest Vietnamese writer of the twentieth century. The novel's clever plot, richly drawn characters and humorous tone and its preoccupation with sex, fashion and capitalism will appeal to a wide audience. It will appeal to students and scholars of Vietnam, comparative literature, colonial and postcolonial studies, and Southeast Asian civilization.Vu Trong Phung died in Hanoi, in 1939 at the age of twenty-seven. He is the author of at least eight novels, seven plays, and several other works of fiction in addition to Dumb Luck.Peter Zinoman is Associate Professor of Southeast Asian History, University of California, Berkeley.

Compared to works by Voltaire and Zola on its original publication, this prescient novel strives to awaken an often unsuspecting, sometimes politically naive, or else willfully blind world to the consequences of its stance in the face of national events -- in this case, the rising tide of Nazism in 1930s Germany.The past and future meet in the saga of the Oppermanns, for three generations a family commercially well established in Berlin. In assimilated citizens like them, the emancipated Jew in Germany has become a fact. In a Berlin inhabited by troops in brown shirts, however, the Oppermanns have more to fear than an alien discomfort. For along with the swastikas and fascist salutes come discrimination, deceit, betrayal, and a tragedy that history has proved to be as true as this novel's astonishing, profoundly moving tale.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Germany', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Holocaust', 'Jewish', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literature']"

Indeed, in Jirel's world, beauty = decadence = corruption.

Her approach to writing is impossible to summarize, but many critics see a strain of American humor in her work, borne out immediately by some of the chapter titles: “Saving the Sentence,” “Arthur a Grammar,” “Regular Regularly in Narrative,” and “Finally George a Vocabulary.”Readers who have not encountered Gertrude Stein or who have had difficulty with her other work will find this book useful as an entry into her writing.

Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances. The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date.

The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.Steven Spielberg movie of this title coming December 2011:","['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Bande Dessinée', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comic Book', 'France', 'Mystery']"

Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste is one of the most important, yet neglected, works of political writing from India. Written in 1936, it is an audacious denunciation of Hinduism and its caste system. Ambedkar – a figure like W.E.B. Du Bois – offers a scholarly critique of Hindu scriptures, scriptures that sanction a rigidly hierarchical and iniquitous social system. The world’s best-known Hindu, Mahatma Gandhi, responded publicly to the provocation. The hatchet was never buried.Arundhati Roy introduces this extensively annotated edition of in “The Doctor and the Saintexamining the persistence of caste in modern India, and how the conflict between Ambedkar and Gandhi continues to resonate. Roy takes us to the beginning of Gandhi’s political career in South Africa, where his views on race, caste and imperialism were shaped. She tracks Ambedkar’s emergence as a major political figure in the national movement, and shows how his scholarship and intelligence illuminated a political struggle beset by sectarianism and obscurantism. Roy breathes new life into Ambedkar’s anti-caste utopia, and says that without a Dalit revolution, India will continue to be hobbled by systemic inequality.","['Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Religion', 'Indian Literature', 'Society', 'Classics']"

The procedure is very tricky. The work must be done rapidly in extreme cold, for even body heat can melt a rare specimen that has been painstakingly mounted. The lighting must be just right to reveal all the nuances of design without producing heat. But the results can be rewarding, as the work of W. A. Bentley proved.For almost half a century, Bentley caught and photographed thousands of snowflakes in his workshop at Jericho, Vermont, and made available to scientists and art instructors samples of his remarkable work. In 1931, the American Meteorological Society gathered together the best of these photomicrographs, plus some slides of frost, glaze, dew on vegetation and spider webs, sleet, and soft hail, and a text by W. J. Humphreys, and had them published. That book is here reproduced, unaltered, and unabridged. Over 2,000 beautiful crystals on these pages reveal the wonder of nature's diversity in uniformity; no two are alike, yet all are based on a common hexagon.The introductory text covers the technique of photographing snow crystals, classification, the fundamentals of crystallography, and markings. There are also brief discussions of the nature and cause of ice flowers, windowpane frost, dew, rime, sleet, and graupel.The book is of great value both to students of ice forms and for textile and other designers who can use the natural designs of these snow crystals in their work.

Why did the brilliant, but cruel, Dr. Gideon Wyck perform an unnecessary amputation on one of his patients? Why does that patient now insist that black devils are trying to steal his soul? What is behind the series of monster babies being born to apparently normal, healthy women? And when Wyck is found dead under peculiar and inexplicable circumstances, who is responsible—and why?The Cadaver of Gideon Wyck, Alexander Laing's odd hybrid of horror, crime and science fiction, was an unlikely bestseller and critical success when first published in 1934, and it was later selected by Karl Edward Wagner as one of the top horror novels of all time.

The Hopkins Manuscript,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2588395-the-hopkins-manuscript,"Recently there was a revival of one of the greatest of C20th stage plays, Journey's End (1929). It was wonderfully acted and produced, prompting us to search out the author's other work. R C Sherriff (1896-1975) had served in WW1; when he returned to his job as an insurance clerk he wrote plays for his local amateur dramatic club and, eventually, Journey's End, based on his letters home from the Front. During the 1930s he worked in Hollywood, writing screenplays for films such as Goodbye Mr Chips (1933) and The Four Feathers (1938); meanwhile he wrote novels, including A Fortnight in September (1931), which Persephone Books will publish in 2006, and a 1939 catastrophe novel 'written' by 'Edgar Hopkins'.I n The Hopkins Manuscript we watch through his eyes as the moon veers off course, draws slowly closer to the earth, and finally crashes into it on May 3rd 1946. Because it falls into the Atlantic much of humanity survives – only to generate new disasters. But this is not science fiction in the mode of H G Wells's The War of the Worlds; it is a novel about human nature.The 'manuscript' was named after its 'author', a retired Hampshire schoolmaster whose greatest interest in life is his Bantam hens; rather self-important and lacking much sense of humour, Edgar Hopkins nevertheless emerges as an increasingly sympathetic and credible character, the ordinary man with whom we very much identify as Sherriff describes the small Hampshire village trying to prepare itself in its last days. In Journey's End he evoked the trench experience as he had lived it; in The Hopkins Manuscript he describes the catastrophe as he might have lived it.But the book is also a superbly written novel in its own right, one which we are sure readers will find as unforgettable as any of Persephone Books' other titles. We defy anyone not to be overwhelmed by the scene when the villagers staunchly play a last game of cricket by the light of the moon that 'hung like a great amber, pock-marked lamp above a billiard-table, so vast and enveloping that the little white-clad cricketers moved without shadows to their appointed places on the field.'So how did 'the destruction of the Western civilisation' happen?  In 1945 (and there is a wonderful irony that, writing in 1939, Sherriff anticipated that our civilisation might be destroyed then) scientists discovered, during an eclipse of the sun, that the moon was twelve seconds late in its arrival and had drawn nearer to the earth by 3,583 miles; subsequent observations showed that it was continuing to approach at a speed increasing steadily by eight miles a day. Disaster had become inevitable.R C Sherriff made the scientific aspect of The Hopkins Manuscript strangely plausible even though, as Michael Moorcock writes in his Preface, 'he did not believe that there was any immediate likelihood of the moon crashing into the Earth.  We write such books not because we are convinced that they describe the future, but because we hope they do not.' Nonetheless, Sherriff's writing is so convincing that we have added a scientific explanation of the events in the book; this was written by the Big Bang scientist George Gamow for a 1963 US reprint.The reason The Hopkins Manuscript was reprinted then was because of the near-catastrophe of the Cuban Missile Crisis the year before; the previous reprint had been in 1958, at the height of the world's desperate anxieties about the H-Bomb; and the original publication was in the spring of 1939 when many believed that, once war was declared, Hitler would destroy civilisation as they knew it. And the 2005 reprint? The largest threat facing mankind today is global warming. The Hopkins manuscript can be read as a gripping and extremely interesting novel in its own right; but also as a parable of the possibly catastrophic effects of climate change.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'British Literature', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Apocalyptic']"

Dzieło wywołało w swoim czasie kontrowersje w związku z postawieniem obok siebie treści religijnych, czerpanych z Apokalipsy świętego Jana, oraz licznych wulgaryzmów, scen wyuzdania czy moralnego zepsucia. Miłosz sugeruje, że w ten sposób poeta pragnął stworzyć nowoczesną odmianę prowokacyjnych zawołań pierwszych chrześcijan do opuszczenia marności tego świata. Szczególnie podkreślanym walorem utworu jest warstwa językowa i kompozycyjna; obok fragmentów realistycznych występują zupełnie fantastyczne, często zaś od tonu błazenady i żartu słownego autor przechodzi do ekspozycji przemocy i destrukcji.","['Poetry', 'Polish Literature']"

In Search of Duende,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31580.In_Search_of_Duende,"The notion of ""duende"" became a cornerstone of Federico Garcia Lorca's poetics over the course of his career. In his lecture ""Play and the Theory of Duende,"" he says, "". . .there are no maps nor disciplines to help us find the duende. We only know that he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass, that he exhausts, that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned. . . ."" The duende is portrayed by Lorca as a demonic earth spirit containing irrationality, earthiness, and a heightened awareness of death. In Search of Duende gathers Lorca's writings about the duende and about three art forms most susceptible to dance, music, and the bullfight. A full bilingual sampling of Lorca's poetry is also included, with special attention to poems arising from traditional Spanish verse forms. The result is an excellent introduction to Lorca's poetry and prose for American readers.","['Poetry', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Spain', 'Philosophy', 'Spanish Literature', 'Art', 'Literary Criticism', 'Literature', '20th Century']"

The Bat Woman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38778656-the-bat-woman,"Lurid 1930s horror thriller, an entertainingly bad potpourri of mad scientists, vampires, sinister Orientals and dumb cops. Cited in Alternative Hall of Fame by Bill Pronzini in Son of Gun-in-Cheek."" - Robert Knowlton.Combines weird menace, detective and science-fictional pulp conventions to produce a story of vampirism in New York City, against a back story involving vampire bats from South America and a half-dozen intercalated 'cases' of vampirism from around the world. The evil German genius Schalkenbach has set up a secret barricaded laboratory in Greenwich Village, where, when he is not conducting experiments on the revived corpse of a beautiful young society woman, he is moodily reciting Wagner on an organ behind a black velvet curtain. The writing is actually rather good when the author confines himself to descriptions of traditional settings (the cozy club on a stormy winter day, etc.), but his characters are barely one-dimensional, the theme is muddled, the action writing ludicrous. Still, in the exuberance of its unintentional cacophony there lies a certain charm. Not to mention the repeated references to ""duckless glands."" Bleiler""The stirring story of the bizarre love of a proud, bitter, misshapen, physical and mental giant for a lovely New York society girl, 'a man you could never forget once you had seen him'. A prodigy of tremendous force who is virtually shunned by polite society. Eric von Schalkenbach resolves to win for himself love and happiness in the civilized world, as his great strength and cunning had won for him fabulous wealth in the role of a strange white god among the savage Indians of the wild Amazon country. When the sex starved monstrosity finds that his adroitness and money fail to attract the lovely Cynthia Winthrop he ruthlessly attempts to win her by seemingly supernatural means-with gruesome and fantastically surprising results.""",['Horror']
Pathetic Symphony: A Novel About Tchaikovsky,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223872.Pathetic_Symphony,"Like Mephisto , Pathetic Symphony is a novel about important artists and their milieu. Drawing his material from documented sources, and without ever distorting historical truth or sacrificing biographical accuracy for the sake of the narrative, Klaus Mann here presents a moving and unforgettable story of a tortured genius of music -- Peter llych Tchaikovsky. When the book was first published in 1948, The New York Times praised its ""erotic passages and the recreation of the European musical society -- Brahms, Wagner, Grieg, Rubinstein, Mussorgsky walk through the pages."" Inextricably bound up with Tchaikovsky's life are people who provide the rich orchestration of the his ""beloved friend"" and mysterious benefactress, Madame von Meek, whom he never met personally; Désirée Artôt, the Belgian singer, with whom the young, struggling composer believed himself madly in love; Antonia Miliukov, the pathetic partner in Tchaikovsky's short-lived and tragic marriage; and Tchaikovsky's nephew Vladimir Davydov, whose youth and charm captured the heart of the older man. Tchaikovsky's trials and triumphs, adventures and strange compulsions, maladjustments and neuroses inspired Klaus Mann's admiration and compassion. Both were cosmopolitans who spent more time abroad than in their own countries; both raised the suspicion and envy of their contemporaries at home. According to Mann, Tchaikovsky was the prototype of a man without a country. In Russia, Tchaikovsky's works were criticized as being too Western, the Germans accused him of Asiatic primitivity, and the Parisians found him overly Germanic. Mann wrote Tchaikovsky's story with the conviction of personal ""I could describe all of it; none of it was alien to me,"" he wrote in The Turning Point. Christopher Isherwood wrote of Mann, his friend, ""From his earliest days, he inhabited the circles of the brilliant and famous. He experienced pleasure and success at an age when one is best able to enjoy them. He traveled widely and continuously -- so much so that the huge upheaval of the Emigration [from Nazi Germany to Holland and then to the U.S.] seemed, as far as he was concerned, to be no more than an extension of his normal way of living. During the last sixteen years of his life, Klaus produced an impressive body of work -- novels, non-fiction books, and innumerable articles -- under circumstances that would have reduced most writers to impotent silence.""","['German Literature', 'Music', 'LGBT', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'Classics', 'Literature']"

E a frase é uma verdadeira carta de intenções. Nenhum outro livro sintetizou tão bem o mundo pulsante do cais de Salvador, com a rica mitologia que gira em torno de Iemanjá, a rainha do mar.Personagens como o jovem mestre de saveiro Guma parecem prisioneiros de um destino traçado há muitas gerações: o dos homens que saem para o mar e que um dia serão levados por Iemanjá, deixando mulher e filhos a esperar, resignados.Mas nesse mundo aparentemente parado no tempo há forças transformadoras em gestação. O médico Rodrigo e a professora Dulce, não por acaso dois forasteiros, procuram despertar a consciência da gente do cais contra o marasmo e a opressão.É esse contraste entre o tempo do mito e o da história que move Mar morto, envolvendo-nos desde a primeira página na prosa calorosa de Jorge Amado.","['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Brazil', 'Classics', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Drama']"

Peter arrives at the dreary house, surprised to find that he sees nothing of the enigmatic Voyt, instead passing his time in lessons with a young German tutor. But it soon becomes clear to Peter that these lessons are only preparations for something much more sinister that Voyt intends to teach him.

I Am Your Brother,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966926-i-am-your-brother,"Publication of I AM YOUR BROTHER is the literary event of the year for Weird fiction. A legendary lost novel, it has until now been virtually unavailable. Originally published in 1935, I AM YOUR BROTHER uses the façade of the traditional horror novel to take a deep dive into the human psyche. It is a monster novel, a locked attic novel, and a mad scientist novel, but it is propelled by a string of scenes that read more like a collection of Marx Brothers outtakes. Juggling humor, horror and dread, the plot gallops along at a delirious pace. At the heart of this fairy tale are a mother and her two sons. They are very poor and live together in London. It is the London between wars. One son is a musician and composer. His whole world revolves around the theater. He has written many unpublished songs, including a symphony called “Dream of London.” Self-absorbed and tormented, Julian has no inkling that he has a brother. He’s lived his entire life thinking himself an only child. This delusion is prolonged because his mother, a rather distant and distracted figure in his life, keeps his brother locked in the attic. The Brother can never see the light of day because he is strikingly hideous, inhuman—a guilty secret the mother must keep hidden from the world. As discombobulated as the plot is, as crazy as the characters are, I AM YOUR BROTHER is an enchanting read. It’s magical and mysterious and is rich in haunting imagery that just knocks you to the floor when you encounter it. It’s after one of these poetic jolts that you who is this Marlowe?

Well, if you're Monica Dickens, you become a cook. She makes the plunge to a life ""below the stairs,"" confident in her abilities to be a cook because she once took a course in French cuisine. She quickly learns the difference between school learning and real life. Scalded milk, dropped roasts, and fallen souffles plague her in her domestic career, but she perseveres. What makes this book so delightful is the sense of humor and drama Monica Dickens brings to her work. From dressing up for job interviews in a ""supporting-a-widowed-mum look"" to eavesdropping on dinner guests, she tackles her work with an enthusiasm for discovery. To her descriptions of battles with crazy scullery maids, abusive employers, and unwieldy custards, she brings a humorous and pointed commentary about the delicate and ongoing war between the wealthy and their servants. Written in 1939, this true-life experience reveals a writer who wasted no opportunity to explore daily lives and dramas.

"Στο χείλος της αβύσσου: Η πλήρης έκδοση του ""Φάμπιαν""",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42421795,"Όταν, το 1931, κυκλοφόρησε για πρώτη φορά το μυθιστόρημα Φάμπιαν του Έριχ Κέστνερ, η εθνικοσοσιαλιστική εφημερίδα Volkischer Beobachter έσπευσε να το χαρακτηρίσει «εκδοτικό σκουπίδι». Ο κριτικός που υπέγραφε το κείμενο ήταν, φυσικά, ανώνυμος και ο χαρακτηρισμός αποτέλεσε, και αποτελεί μέχρι σήμερα, τίτλο τιμής. Άλλωστε, λίγους μόλις μήνες αργότερα, το βιβλίο είχε πουλήσει πάνω από 30.000 αντίτυπα, σημειώνοντας μεγάλη επιτυχία.Κι όμως, το αριστούργημα του Κέστνερ δεν ευτύχησε να παρουσιαστεί στους αναγνώστες, όπως ακριβώς το έγραψε και το παρέδωσε ο ίδιος ο δημιουργός του. Ο επιμελητής και ο εκδότης προχώρησαν σε μια σειρά αλλαγών. Κι ένα ολόκληρο κεφάλαιο λογοκρίθηκε. Χρειάστηκε να περάσουν δεκαετίες, για να κυκλοφορήσει το βιβλίο για πρώτη φορά πλήρες και χωρίς περικοπές. Η ανά χείρας έκδοση περιλαμβάνει την αρχική μορφή και τον αρχικό τίτλο του μυθιστορήματος, ενώ στο Παράρτημα οι αναγνώστες έχουν την ευκαιρία να παρακολουθήσουν λεπτομερώς την περιπέτεια του βιβλίου.Ο συγγραφέας αφηγείται την ιστορία του Γιάκομπ Φάμπιαν, άνεργου διδάκτορα της φιλολογίας, ο οποίος, στις αρχές της δεκαετίας του ’30, εξερευνά τον βερολινέζικο κόσμο της νύχτας. Γύρω του ακμάζουν τα πορνεία, τα ατελιέ των καλλιτεχνών και τα παράνομα καμπαρέ, η ανεργία μαστίζει την κοινωνία, ο πληθωρισμός καλπάζει, οι ιδεολογικές αντιπαραθέσεις καταλήγουν σε βίαιες συγκρούσεις. Η Δημοκρατία της Βαϊμάρης καταρρέει, η πόλη βρίσκεται σε κατάσταση έκτακτης ανάγκης, οι κάτοικοί της ζουν, ερωτεύονται, πολιτικοποιούνται σαν να μην υπάρχει αύριο, βιώνουν την πνευματική τους παρακμή και βυθίζονται στο αλκοόλ και στις καταχρήσεις, γνωρίζοντας πολύ καλά πως το μέλλον δεν υπόσχεται τίποτα. Και, μέσα στη γενικευμένη ανηθικότητα, ο ήρωας του έργου παλεύει να επιβιώσει, παραμένοντας ένας ηθικός άνθρωπος.Ο Κέστνερ, ένας από τους σημαντικότερους Γερμανούς συγγραφείς, με εντυπωσιακή γλωσσική μαεστρία, προσφέρει στους αναγνώστες ένα εξαιρετικά απολαυστικό μυθιστόρημα και ταυτόχρονα προφητική μαρτυρία για την Ευρώπη του Μεσοπολέμου και την εποχή πριν από την άνοδο του Χίτλερ στην εξουσία.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Germany', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', '20th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Roman']"

The crimes have baffled the police and enraged Londoners, who demand the murderer's arrest. Mary, Duchess of Dove, a gentle young widow who is beloved by all who know her, seems an unlikely suspect, but the clues all point to her. The police have a variety of theories - perhaps the Duchess has been hypnotized or drugged, maybe she has an evil double, or could it be a Communist plot to discredit the peerage?

The story was especially timely, considering the tensions in Europe when it was written. Stalin had just seized power in Russia, Mussolini was urging Italians to recapture the glory of the Roman Empire, and Hitler with his rhetoric was quickly gaining steam in Germany.","['Classics', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Germany', 'Nobel Prize', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction']"

An Actor's Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2843351-an-actor-s-work,"Stanislavski’s ‘system’ has dominated actor-training in the West since his writings were first translated into English in the 1920s and 30s. His systematic attempt to outline a psycho-physical technique for acting single-handedly revolutionized standards of acting in the theatre. Until now, readers and students have had to contend with inaccurate, misleading and difficult-to-read English-language versions. Some of the mistranslations have resulted in profound distortions in the way his system has been interpreted and taught. At last, Jean Benedetti has succeeded in translating Stanislavski’s huge manual into a lively, fascinating and accurate text in English. He has remained faithful to the author's original intentions, putting the two books previously known as An Actor Prepares and Building A Character back together into one volume, and in a colloquial and readable style for today's actors.

Love in the Western World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/874923.Love_in_the_Western_World,"In this classic work, often described as ""The History of the Rise, Decline, and Fall of the Love Affair,"" Denis de Rougemont explores the psychology of love from the legend of Tristan and Isolde to Hollywood. At the heart of his ever-relevant inquiry is the inescapable conflict in the West between marriage and passion—the first associated with social and religious responsiblity and the second with anarchic, unappeasable love as celebrated by the troubadours of medieval Provence. These early poets, according to de Rougemont, spoke the words of an Eros-centered theology, and it was through this ""heresy"" that a European vocabulary of mysticism flourished and that Western literature took on a new direction.Bringing together historical, religious, philosophical, and cultural dimensions, the author traces the evolution of Western romantic love from its literary beginnings as an awe-inspiring secret to its commercialization in the cinema. He seeks to restore the myth of love to its original integrity and concludes with a philosophical perspective on modern marriage.","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Love', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Cultural', 'France', 'Literature', 'Poetry']"

Industrial Park,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2258001.Industrial_Park,"A member of Brazil's avant-garde in its heyday, Patrícia Galvão (or, to use her nickname, Pagu) was extraordinary.

Industrial Park, first published in 1933, is Galvão's most notable literary achievement. Like Döblin's portrayal of Berlin in Alexanderplatz or Biely's St Petersburg, it is a book about the voices, clashes, and traffic of a city in the middle of rapid change. It includes fragments of public documents as well as dialogue and narration, giving a panorama of the city in a sequence of colorful slices.","['Fiction', 'Brazil', 'Literature', 'Womens', 'Novels', 'Latin American', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Portuguese Literature']"

Convinced that scholars and teachers give a false sense of literature, Ford brings alive the pleasures of reading by writing about books he is passionate about.Beginning at the beginning with ancient Egyptian and Chinese literature and the Bible Ford works his way through classical literature, the writings of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, continuing up to the major writers of his own day like Ezra Pound, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. With his encyclopedic reading and expertise in the techniques of writing, Ford is a reliable and entertaining guide.

The Villagers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114568.The_Villagers,"The Villagers is a story of the ruthless exploitation and extermination of an Indian village of Ecuador by its greedy landlord. First published in 1934, it is here available for the first time in an authorized English translation. A realistic tale in the best tradition of the novels of social protest of Zola, Dosto­evsky, José Eustasio Rivera, and the Mexican novels of the Revolution, The Villagers (Huasipungo) shocked and horrified its readers, and brought its author mingled censure and acclaim, when it was first published in 1934. Deeply moving in the dramatic intensity of its relentless evolution and stark human suffering, Icaza’s novel has been translated into eleven foreign languages, including Russian and Chinese, and has gone through numerous editions in Spanish, including a revised and enlarged edition in 1953, on which this translation is based, but it has never before been authorized for translation into English. His first novel, but not his first published work, The Villagers is still considered by most critics as Icaza’s best, and it is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant works in contemporary Latin American literature. Thirty years after its original publication in Ecuador, The Villagers still carries a powerful message for the contemporary world and an urgent warning. The conditions here portrayed prevail in these areas, even today. The Villagers is an indictment of the latifundista system and a caustic picture of the native worker who, with little expectation from life, finds himself a victim of an antiquated feudal system aided and abetted by a grasping clergy and an indifferent govern­ment.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American Literature', 'Latin American', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Academic']"

In Hazard,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2376114.In_Hazard,"The Archimedes is a modern merchant steamship in tip-top condition, and in the summer of 1929 it has been picking up goods along the eastern seaboard of the United States before making a run to China. A little overloaded, perhaps—the oddly assorted cargo includes piles of old newspapers and heaps of tobacco—the ship departs for the Panama Canal from Norfolk, Virginia, on a beautiful autumn day. Before long, the weather turns unexpectedly rough—rougher in fact than even the most experienced members of the crew have ever encountered. The Archimedes, it turns out, has been swept up in the vortex of an immense hurricane, and for the next four days it will be battered and mauled by wind and waves as it is driven wildly off course. Caught in an unremitting struggle for survival, both the crew and the ship will be tested as never before.Based on detailed research into an actual event, Richard Hughes’s tale of high suspense on the high seas is an extraordinary story of men under pressure and the unexpected ways they prove their mettle—or crack. Yet the originality, art, and greatness of stem from something else: Hughes’s eerie fascination with the hurricane itself, the inhuman force around which this wrenching tale of humanity at its limits revolves. Hughes channels the furies of sea and sky into a piece of writing that is both apocalyptic and analytic. is an unforgettable, defining work of modern adventure.","['Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Survival']"

Particularly valuable are the connections it draws across his work and the insights which the introduction and glossary provide into the origin and development of some key Gramscian concepts.""--Stuart Hall, Professor of Sociology, Open UniversityThe most complete one-volume collection of writings by one of the most fascinating thinkers in the history of Marxism, fills the need for a broad and general introduction to this major figure.Antonio Gramsci was one of the most important theorists of class, culture, and the state since Karl Marx. In the U.S., where his writings were long unavailable, his stature has lately so increased that every serious student of Marxism, political theory, or modern Italian history must now read him.Imprisoned by the Fascists for much of his adult life, Gramsci wrote brilliantly on a broad range of subjects: from folklore to philosophy, popular culture to political strategy. Still the most comprehensive collection of Gramsci's writings available in English, it now features a new introduction by leading Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, in addition to its biographical introduction, informative introductions to each section, and glossary of key terms.","['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Italy', 'Political Science', 'Economics', 'Classics']"

"Living My Life, Vol. 2",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27699.Living_My_Life_Vol_2,"“You damn bitch of an anarchist, I wish I could get at you. I would tear your heart out and feed it to my dog.” This was one of the less obscene messages received by Emma Goldman (1869-1940), while in jail on suspicion of complicity in the assassination of McKinley. The most notorious woman of her day, she was bitterly hated by millions and equally revered by millions.The strong feelings she aroused are understandable. She was an alien, a practicing anarchist, a labor agitator, a pacifist in World War 1, an advocate of political violence, a feminist, a proponent of free love and birth control, a communist, a street-fighter for justice — all of which she did with strong intellect and boundless passion. Today, of course, many of the issues that she fought over are just as vital as they were then.Emma Goldman came from Russia at the age of 17. After an encounter with the sweatshop and an unfortunate marriage, she plunged into the bewildering intellectual and activist chaos that attended American social evolution around the turn of the twentieth century. She knew practically everyone of importance in radical circles. She dominated many areas of the radical movement, lecturing, writing, haranguing, and publishing to awaken the world to her ideas. After World War I she was deported to Russia, where she soon discovered that anarchists were no better liked than in America, despite Lenin’s first gesture of welcome. She escaped with her life but never was allowed to return to the United States.Emma Goldman was a devastatingly honest woman, who spared herself as little as she spared anyone else. From her account the reader can gain insight into a curious personality type of recurrent a woman who devoted her life to eliminating suffering, yet could make a bomb or assist in staging an assassination. Equally interesting are her comments on other radicals of the period, such as Kropotkin, Berkman, Mooney, Lenin, Trotsky, Haywood, Most, the Haymarket martyrs, and many others. Her autobiography, written with vigor, ranks among the finest in the English language.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Russia', 'Biography Memoir']"

The Great War is raging through Europe, and in the ancient, mountainous lands southwest of the Caspian Sea the Turks have begun systematically to exterminate their Christian subjects. Unable to deny his birthright or his people, one man, Gabriel Bagradian—born an Armenian, educated in Paris, married to a Frenchwoman, and an officer doing his duty as a Turkish subject in the Ottoman army—will strive to resist death at the hands of his blood enemy by leading 5,000 Armenian villagers to the top of Musa Dagh, “the mountain of Moses.” There, for forty days, in the face of almost certain death, they will suffer the siege of a Turkish army hell-bent on genocide. A passionate warning against the dangers of racism and scapegoating, and prefiguring the ethnic horrors of World War II, this important novel from the early 1930s remains the only significant treatment, in fiction or nonfiction, of the first genocide in the twentieth century’s long series of inhumanities. It also continues to be today what the New York Times deemed it in 1933—“a true and thrilling novel ... a story which must rouse the emotions of all human beings.” “Musa Dagh gives us a lasting sense of participation in a stirring episode of history....

Saint Thomas Aquinas,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25708.Saint_Thomas_Aquinas,"G.K.

Then it earned the praise of such distinguished writers as Etienne Gilson, Jacques Martain, and Anton Pegis as the best book ever written on the great thirteenth-century Dominican. Today Chesterton's classic stands poised to reveal Thomas to a new generation.Chesterton's Aquinas is a man of mystery. Born into a noble Neapolitan family, Thomas chose the life of a mendicant friar. Lumbering and shy -- his classmates dubbed him ""the Dumb Ox"" -- he led a revolution in Christian thought. Possessed of the rarest brilliance, he found the highest truth in the humblest object. Having spent his life amid the vast intricacies of reason, he asked on his deathbed to have read aloud the Song of Songs, the most passionate book in the Bible.As Albert the Great, Thomas's teacher, predicted, the Dumb Ox has bellowed down the ages to our own day. Chesterton's book will enlighten those who would consign Thomas to the obscurity of medieval times. It will confound those who would use Thomas to bolster arid schemes of Christian rationalism. Rather, it will introduce the wondrous mystery of the man who, after a life of unparalleled genius, was seized by a vision of the Unknown and said, ""I can write no more.

The People Of The Black Circle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4413346-the-people-of-the-black-circle,"Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) was an American pulp writer of fantasy, horror, historical adventure, boxing, western, and detective fiction. He is well known for having created the character Conan the Cimmerian, a literary icon whose pop-culture imprint can be compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond. Voracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, conspired to create in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. One by one he discovered the authors that would influence his later work: Jack London and Rudyard Kipling. It's clear from Howard's earliest writings and the recollections of his friends that he suffered from severe depression from an early age. Friends recall him defending the act of suicide as a valid alternative as early as eighteen years old, while many of his stories and poems have a suicidal gloom and intensity that seem prescient in hindsight, describing such an end not as a tragedy but as a release from hell on earth.","['Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Short Stories', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Sword and Sorcery', 'Novella', 'Dark Fantasy']"

Mohammed and Charlemagne,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334214.Mohammed_and_Charlemagne,"The final work of the great Belgian historian Henri Pirenne, this remarkable classic — published after his death — offers a revolutionary perspective on how Europe under the influence of a Roman Empire centered in Constantinople evolved into the Europe of Charlemagne and the Middle Ages.Departing from the standard view that Germanic invasions obliterated the Roman Empire, Pirenne advances the radical new thesis that ""the cause of the break with the tradition of antiquity was the rapid and unexpected advance of Islam,"" and event of historical proportions that prevented the western Mediterranean from being what it had always been: a thoroughfare of commerce and thought. It became instead what Pirenne refers to as ""a Musulman lake,"" thereby causing ""the axis of life [to shift] northwards from the Mediterranean"" for the first time in history.Brilliant and controversial, this volume garnered these words of praise from the critics: ""It is a dull reader indeed who does not recognize the light of genius in the pages of this book, without doubt a landmark in contemporary historiography."" — G. C. Boyce, Annals of the American Academy . ""… Pirenne's crowning triumph. The fire of his genius, the boldness of his mind, his profound learning and vivid pen make this volume pleasant reading."" — Commonweal . ""… an important, seminal book, worthy to close one of the most distinguished careers in European scholarship."" — Saturday Review of Literature .Pirenne's masterly study is essential reading for history students, medievalists, and general readers with an interest in the decline of the Roman Empire and the beginnings of the Middle Ages.","['History', 'Medieval', 'Medieval History', 'Nonfiction', 'Islam', 'European History', 'Religion', 'France', 'Biography', 'World History']"

Some Versions of Pastoral,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1004274.Some_Versions_of_Pastoral,"Some Versions of Pastoral is considered a landmark of modern literary criticism. Mr. Empson sees the pastoral convention as including not only poems of shepherd life but any work ""about the people but not by or for"" them. Finding examples in the writing of every country and century, from Mencius to William Faulkner or Céline, he concentrates on an analysis of certain works and forms in English literature, several of them, like Alice in Wonderland , Troilus and Cressida , and proletarian novels not traditionally considered pastoral. His chapter on Milton and Bentley is a precursor of Mr. Empson’s 1961 book, Milton’s God . With virtuoso clarity and perception throughout he brings the student to a new awareness of hidden values in individual works and to the creative possibilities of the language.","['Criticism', 'Literary Criticism', '20th Century', 'Poetry', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Literature', 'Theory']"
