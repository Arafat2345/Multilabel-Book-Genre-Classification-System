It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.

Slaughterhouse-Five,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five,"Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”An instant bestseller, made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it.Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.","['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'American']"

Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc.

Catch-22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168668.Catch_22,"Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time.

But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

Fanon's masterwork is a classic alongside Edward Said's Orientalism or The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and it is now available in a new translation that updates its language for a new generation of readers.The Wretched of the Earth is a brilliant analysis of the psychology of the colonized and their path to liberation. Bearing singular insight into the rage and frustration of colonized peoples, and the role of violence in effecting historical change, the book incisively attacks the twin perils of post-independence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the elites on the one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other.Fanon's analysis, a veritable handbook of social reorganization for leaders of emerging nations, has been reflected all too clearly in the corruption and violence that has plagued present-day Africa. has had a major impact on civil rights, anticolonialism, and black consciousness movements around the world, and this bold new translation by Richard Philcox reaffirms it as a landmark.","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Race', 'Psychology']"

This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other—subject to fear, doubt, and pain.In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God’s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ’s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.“Spiritual dynamite.” — San Francisco Chronicle“A searing, soaring, shocking novel.” — Time","['Fiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Greece', 'Christianity', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality']"
"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9590.God_Bless_You_Mr_Rosewater,"Second only to Slaughterhouse-Five of Vonnegut's canon in its prominence and influence, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965) presents Eliot Rosewater, an itinerant, semi-crazed millionaire wandering the country in search of heritage and philanthropic outcome, introducing the science fiction writer Kilgore Trout to the world and Vonnegut to the collegiate audience which would soon make him a cult writer.Trout, modeled according to Vonnegut on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (with whom Vonnegut had an occasional relationship) is a desperate, impoverished but visionary hack writer who functions for Eliot Rosewater as both conscience and horrid example. Rosewater, seeking to put his inheritance to some meaningful use (his father was an entrepreneur), tries to do good within the context of almost illimitable cynicism and corruption.It is in this novel that Rosewater wanders into a science fiction conference--an actual annual event in Milford, Pennsylvania--and at the motel delivers his famous monologue evoked by science fiction writers and critics for almost half a century: ""None of you can write for sour apples... but you're the only people trying to come to terms with the really terrific things which are happening today."" Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition.The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical. The novel is told mostly thru a collection of short stories dealing with Eliot's interactions with the citizens of Rosewater County, usually with the last sentence serving as a punch line. The antagonist's tale, Mushari's, is told in a similar short essay fashion. The stories reveal different hypocrisies of humankind in a darkly humorous fashion.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Contemporary']"
The Cantos,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/269589.The_Cantos,"The Cantos by Ezra Pound is a long, incomplete poem in 116 sections, each of which is a canto. Most of it was written between 1915 and 1962, although much of the early work was abandoned and the early cantos, as finally published, date from 1922 onwards. It is a book-length work, widely considered to be an intense and challenging read. The Cantos is generally considered one of the most significant works of modernist poetry in the 20th century. As in Pound's prose writing, the themes of economics, governance and culture are integral to the work's content.The most striking feature of the text, to a casual browser, is the inclusion of Chinese characters as well as quotations in European languages other than English. A close reader will normally require a scholarly commentary to help understand the text. The range of allusion to historical events is broad, and abrupt changes occur with little transition.There is also wide geographical reference. Pound added to his earlier interests in the classical Mediterranean culture and East Asia selective topics from medieval and early modern Italy and Provence, the beginnings of the United States, England of the 17th century, and details from Africa he had obtained from Leo Frobenius. Many references in the text lack explanation. Pound initially believed that he possessed poetic and rhetorical techniques which would themselves generate significance, but as time passed he became more concerned with the messages he wished to convey.The section he wrote at the end of World War II, begun while he was interned in American-occupied Italy, has become known as The Pisan Cantos. It was awarded the first Bollingen Prize in 1948. There were many repercussions, since this in effect honoured a poet who was under indictment for treason.:::Delmore Schwartz said about , ""They are one of the touchstones of modern poetry."" William Carlos Williams said, ""[Pound] discloses history by its odor, by the feel of it—in the words; fuses it with the words, present and past, to MAKE his . them.""Since the 1969 revised edition, the Italian Cantos LXXII and LXXIII (as well as a 1966 fragment concluding the work) have been added. Now appearing for the first time is Pound's recently found English translation of Italian Canto LXXII.","['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Fiction', 'American', '20th Century', 'The United States Of America', 'Epic', 'Epic Poetry', 'Unfinished']"

It is one of Edward Gorey's best-known books, and is the most notorious amongst his roughly half-dozen mock alphabets.[2] It has been described as a ""sarcastic rebellion against a view of childhood that is sunny, idyllic, and instructive"". The morbid humor of the book comes in part from the mundane ways in which children die, such as falling down the stairs or choking on a peach. Far from illustrating the dramatic and fantastical childhood nightmares, these scenarios instead poke fun at the banal paranoias that come as a part of parenting.","['Humor', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Art', 'Picture Books', 'Graphic Novels', 'Poetry', 'Comics', 'Childrens', 'Classics']"

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61539.The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions,"A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.With Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context.  Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.","['Science', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Sociology', 'History Of Science', 'Classics', 'Physics', 'Academic', 'Theory']"

Set in the late 1600s, it recounts the wildly chaotic odyssey of hapless, ungainly Ebenezer Cooke, sent to the New World to look after his father's tobacco business and to record the struggles of the Maryland colony in an epic poem.On his mission, Cooke experiences capture by pirates and Indians; the loss of his father's estate to roguish impostors; love for a farmer prostitute; stealthy efforts to rob him of his virginity, which he is (almost) determined to protect; and an extraordinary gallery of treacherous characters who continually switch identities. A hilarious, bawdy tribute to all the most insidious human vices, has a lasting relevance for readers of all times.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'The United States Of America']"

A Grief Observed,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49221.A_Grief_Observed,"Written with love, humility, and faith, this brief but poignant volume was first published in 1961 and concerns the death of C. S. Lewis's wife, the American-born poet Joy Davidman. In her introduction to this new edition, Madeleine L'Engle writes: ""I am grateful to Lewis for having the courage to yell, to doubt, to kick at God in angry violence. This is a part of a healthy grief which is not often encouraged. It is helpful indeed that C. S. Lewis, who has been such a successful apologist for Christianity, should have the courage to admit doubt about what he has so superbly proclaimed. It gives us permission to admit our own doubts, our own angers and anguishes, and to know that they are part of the soul's growth.""Written in longhand in notebooks that Lewis found in his home, A Grief Observed probes the ""mad midnight moments"" of Lewis's mourning and loss, moments in which he questioned what he had previously believed about life and death, marriage, and even God. Indecision and self-pity assailed Lewis. ""We are under the harrow and can't escape,"" he writes. ""I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get. The old life, the jokes, the drinks, the arguments, the lovemaking, the tiny, heartbreaking commonplace."" Writing A Grief Observed as ""a defense against total collapse, a safety valve,"" he came to recognize that ""bereavement is a universal and integral part of our experience of love.""Lewis writes his statement of faith with precision, humor, and grace. Yet neither is Lewis reluctant to confess his continuing doubts and his awareness of his own human frailty. This is precisely the quality which suggests that A Grief Observed may become ""among the great devotional books of our age.""","['Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Memoir', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Faith', 'Biography']"

Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/582067.Anti_Intellectualism_in_American_Life,"Anti-intellectualism in American Life was awarded the 1964 Pulitzer Prize in Non-Fiction. It is a book which throws light on many features of the American character. Its concern is not merely to portray the scorners of intellect in American life, but to say something about what the intellectual is, and can be, as a force in a democratic society.Hofstadter set out to trace the social movements that altered the role of intellect in American society from a virtue to a vice. In so doing, he explored questions regarding the purpose of education and whether the democratization of education altered that purpose and reshaped its form.In considering the historic tension between access to education and excellence in education, Hofstadter argued that both anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were consequences, in part, of the democratization of knowledge.Moreover, he saw these themes as historically embedded in America's national fabric, an outcome of her colonial European and evangelical Protestant heritage. Anti-intellectualism and utilitarianism were functions of American cultural heritage, not necessarily of democracy.","['History', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'American History', 'Education', 'American', 'Cultural', 'Political Science']"

Each of these books is narrated by a strong woman growing up in the town and struggling with physical and emotional isolation.In The Stone Angel , Hagar Shipley, age ninety, tells the story of her life, and in doing so tries to come to terms with how the very qualities which sustained her have deprived her of joy. Mingling past and present, she maintains pride in the face of senility, while recalling the life she led as a rebellious young bride, and later as a grieving mother. Laurence gives us in Hagar a woman who is funny, infuriating, and heartbreakingly poignant.""This is a revelation, not impersonation. The effect of such skilled use of language is to lead the reader towards the self-recognition that Hagar misses.""—Robertson Davies, New York Times""It is [Laurence's] admirable achievement to strike, with an equally sure touch, the peculiar note and the universal; she gives us a portrait of a remarkable character and at the same time the picture of old age itself, with the pain, the weariness, the terror, the impotent angers and physical mishaps, the realization that others are waiting and wishing for an end.""—Honor Tracy, The New Republic""Miss Laurence is the best fiction writer in the Dominion and one of the best in the hemisphere.""— Atlantic""[Laurence] demonstrates in The Stone Angel that she has a true novelist's gift for catching a character in mid-passion and life at full flood. . . .

We sympathize with her in her resistance to being moved to a nursing home, in her preposterous flight, in her impatience in the hospital. Battered, depleted, suffering, she rages with her last breath against the dying of the light. The Stone Angel is a fine novel, admirably written and sustained by unfailing insight.""—Granville Hicks, Saturday Review"" The Stone Angel is a good book because Mrs. Laurence avoids sentimentality and condescension; Hagar Shipley is still passionately involved in the puzzle of her own nature. . . .

The Great Hunger : Ireland 1845-9,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12893032-the-great-hunger,"The Irish potato famine of the 1840s, perhaps the most appalling event of the Victorian era, killed over a million people and drove as many more to emigrate to America. It may not have been the result of deliberate government policy, yet British 'obtuseness, short-sightedness and ignorance' - and stubborn commitment to laissez-faire 'solutions' - largely caused the disaster and prevented any serious efforts to relieve suffering. The continuing impact on Anglo-Irish relations was incalculable, the immediate human cost almost inconceivable. In this vivid and disturbing book, Cecil Woodham-Smith provides the definitive account.

For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators.

Fat City,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154869.Fat_City,"Fat City is a novel about the indestructibility of of hope, the anguish and comedy of the human condition. It tells the story of two young boxers out of Stockton, California: Ernie Munger and Billy Tully, one in his late teens, the other just turning thirty, whose seemingly parallel lives intersect for a time. Set in an ambiance of glittering dreams and drab realities, it tells of the two fighters' struggles to escape the confinements of their existence, and of the men and women in their world. Fat City is a novel about the sporting life like no other ever written: without melodrama or false heroics, written with a truthfulness that is at once painful and beautiful.""Between the ages of 19 and 25 I studied Leonard Gardner’s book so closely that I began to fear I’d never be able to write anything but imitations of it, so I swore it off(...)When I was about 34 (the same age Gardner was when he published his), my first novel came out. About a year later I borrowed from the library and read it. I could see immediately that ten years’ exile hadn’t saved me from the influence of its perfection — I’d taught myself to write in Gardner’s style, though not as well. And now, many years later, it’s still true: Leonard Gardner has something to say in every word I write.""""Leonard Gardner's affected me more than any new fiction I have read in a long while, and I do not think it affected me only because I come from Fat City, or somewhere near it. He has got it exactly right--the hanging around gas stations, the field dust, the relentless oppressiveness of the weather, the bleak liaisons sealed on the levees and Greyhound buses--but he has done more than just get it down, he has made it a metaphor for the joyless in heart.""""The people he writes about are alive and three-dimensional, and have that meaty, sweaty immediacy I admire in novels and find so seldom. It's an odd, interesting world he explores here--as tense and vivid as the prose.""""Gardner writes with power, with an insider's knowledge, and with a vividness and love for his characters which redeem them even when they're lost and beaten.""""A man of real talent. He makes the savage world he writes of come alive to the point where the reader can smell the sweat, and feel the anguish of unremitting failure.""Ross Macdonald: ""In his pity and art Gardner moves beyond race, beyond guilt and punishment, as Twain and Melville did, into a tragic forgiveness. I have seldom read a novel as beautiful and individual as this one.""Originally published in 1969, Fat City is an American classic whose stature has increased over the years. Made into an acclaimed film by John Huston, the book is set in and around Stockton, California.","['Fiction', 'Sports', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'American', 'Noir', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'The United States Of America']"

In the retelling, Olympus becomes small-town Olinger High School; Chiron is George Caldwell, a science teacher there; and Prometheus is Caldwell’s fifteen-year-old son, Peter.

The result, said the judges of the National Book Award, is “a courageous and brilliant account of a conflict in gifts between an inarticulate American father and his highly articulate son.”","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'American', 'Mythology', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Fantasy', '20th Century', 'American Fiction']"

For how will I be able to speak without the word lying for me?"" These linguistic games frame existential and experiential crises that Lispector savors and overcomes.

Unsafe at Any Speed,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193420.Unsafe_at_Any_Speed,"For decades, Ralph Nader (b. 2/27/34) has challenged corporations, government agencies & institutions to be more accountable to the public. In 1965, ""Unsafe at Any Speed"" changed the face of the automobile industry & made him a household name. As a result of his efforts, cars have more safety features. His lobbying & writing on the food industry insured that the food we buy is required to pass strict guidelines before reaching the consumer. One of his greatest achievements was the 1974 amendment to the Freedom of Information Act that gave increased public access to government documents. This brought freedom of press to a new level, resulting in increased access for journalists. He's cofounded numerous public interest groups including Public Citizen, Critical Mass, Commercial Alert & the Center for Study of Responsive Law. In 2000 he mounted a 2nd bid for president as a candidate for the Green Party, & today continues to be a relentless force for grassroots activism & democratic change in the USA.","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Education', 'Cultural', 'Cars', 'Science', 'Sustainability', 'Transport']"

The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119561.The_Order_of_Things,"Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found here.With vast erudition, Foucault cuts across disciplines and reaches back into seventeenth century to show how classical systems of knowledge, which linked all of nature within a great chain of being and analogies between the stars in the heavens and the features in a human face, gave way to the modern sciences of biology, philology, and political economy. The result is nothing less than an archaeology of the sciences that unearths old patterns of meaning and reveals the shocking arbitrariness of our received truths.In the work that established him as the most important French thinker since Sartre, Michel Foucault offers startling evidence that “man”—man as a subject of scientific knowledge—is at best a recent invention, the result of a fundamental mutation in our culture.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theory', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'France', 'Anthropology', 'Academic', 'Psychology']"
Instant Replay: The Green Bay Diary of Jerry Kramer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34792.Instant_Replay,"In 1967, when Jerry Kramer was a thirty-one-year-old Green Bay Packers offensive lineman, in his tenth year with the team, he decided to keep a diary of the season. “Perhaps, by setting down my daily thoughts and observations,” he wrote, “I’ll be able to understand precisely what it is that draws me back to professional football.” Working with the renowned journalist Dick Schaap, Kramer recorded his day-to-day experiences as a player with perception, honesty, humor, and startling sensitivity. Little did Kramer know that the 1967 season would be one of the most remarkable in the history of pro football, culminating with the legendary championship game against Dallas now known as the “Ice Bowl,” in which Kramer would play a central role. Nor could he have anticipated that his diary would evolve into a book titled Instant Replay , first published in 1968, that would become a multimillion-copy bestseller and be celebrated by reviewers everywhere, including the Washington Post ’s Jonathan Yardley, who calls it “to this day, the best inside account of pro football, indeed the best book ever written about that sport and that league.”This groundbreaking look inside the world of professional football is one of the first books ever to take readers into the locker room and reveal the inner workings of a professional sports franchise. From training camp, through the historic Ice Bowl, then into the locker room of Super Bowl II, Kramer provides a captivating player’s perspective on pro football when the game was all blood, grit, and tears. He also offers a rare and insightful view of the team’s storied leader, Coach Vince Lombardi. Bringing the book back into print for the first time in more than a decade, this new edition of Instant Replay retains the classic look of the original and includes a foreword by Jonathan Yardley and additional rarely seen photos from the celebrated “Lombardi era.” As vivid and engaging as it was when it was first published, Instant Replay is an irreplaceable reminder of the glory days of pro football.","['Sports', 'Football', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook']"

Focusing on the world of the emperor's court-the world so admired by Virginia Woolf and others-he describes the politics, society, religious life, and superstitions of the times, providing detailed portrayals of the daily life of courtiers, the cult of beauty they espoused, and the intricate relations between the men and women of this milieu.","['History', 'Japan', 'Nonfiction', 'Asia', 'Japanese Literature', 'Historical', 'Japanese History', 'Cultural', 'Reference', 'Asian Literature']"

Pornografia,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475965.Pornografia,"Gombrowicz's strange, bracing final novel probes the divide between young and old while providing a grotesque evocation of obsession. While recuperating from wartime Warsaw in the Polish countryside, the unnamed narrator and his friend, Fryderyk, attempt to force amour between two local youths, Karol and Henia, as a kind of a lewd entertainment. They become increasingly frustrated as they discover that the two have no interest in one another, and the games are momentarily stopped by a local murder and a directive to assassinate a rogue member of the Polish resistance. Gombrowicz connects these threads magnificently in a tense climax that imbues his novel with a deep sense of the absurd and multiplies its complexity. Gombrowicz is a relentless psychoanalyzer and a consummate stylist; his prose is precise and forceful, and the narrator's strained attempts to elucidate why he takes such pleasure at soiling youth creepily evoke authentic pride and disgust. Borchardt's translation (the first into English from the original Polish) is a model of consistency, maintaining a manic tone as it navigates between lengthy, comma-spliced sentences and sharp, declarative thrusts. - Publishers Weekly","['Fiction', 'Polish Literature', 'Poland', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Philosophy', 'European Literature', 'World War II']"

The hero here, of course, is Captain James Cook, with Moorehead concentrating on the voyage to Tahiti, New Zealand & Australia, & the later exploration of the Antarctic Circle & the South Pole. As acknowledged, he's drawn heavily on the historian J.C. Beaglehole's definitive volumes, as well as from other weighty sources. But this should not dismay the layman.

The confrontation between aggressive Europeans & innocent primitive tribes affords ample opportunity. The book is a requiem for an idyllic past, moving in its picture of a wild civilization slowly eroding under the impact of commercial progress or geographical expansion, exciting in its interplay of differing psychological attitudes or customs, & developed with many crisscrossing references: Bougainville & Banks, Melville & Gauguin, the Bounty mutiny & the little known efforts of the Englishwoman Daisy Bates to save the Aborigines.

The Frontiersmen: A Narrative,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/825598.The_Frontiersmen,"The frontiersmen were a remarkable breed of men. They were often rough and illiterate, sometimes brutal and vicious, often seeking an escape in the wilderness of mid-America from crimes committed back east. In the beautiful but deadly country which would one day come to be known as West Virginia, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, more often than not they left their bones to bleach beside forest paths or on the banks of the Ohio River, victims of Indians who claimed the vast virgin territory and strove to turn back the growing tide of whites. These frontiersmen are the subjects of Allan Eckert's dramatic history. Against the background of such names as George Rogers Clark, Daniel Boone, Arthur St. Clair, Anthony Wayne, Simon Girty and William Henry Harrison, Eckert has recreated the life of one of America's most outstanding heroes, Simon Kenton. Kenton's role in opening the Northwest Territory to settlement more than rivaled that of his friend Daniel Boone. By his eighteenth birthday, Kenton had already won frontier renown as woodsman, fighter and scout. His incredible physical strength and endurance, his great dignity and innate kindness made him the ideal prototype of the frontier hero. Yet there is another story to The Frontiersmen. It is equally the story of one of history's greatest leaders, whose misfortune was to be born to a doomed cause and a dying race. Tecumseh, the brilliant Shawnee chief, welded together by the sheer force of his intellect and charisma an incredible Indian confederacy that came desperately close to breaking the thrust of the white man's westward expansion. Like Kenton, Tecumseh was the paragon of his people's virtues, and the story of his life, in Allan Eckert's hands, reveals most profoundly the grandeur and the tragedy of the American Indian. No less importantly, The Frontiersmen is the story of wilderness America itself, its penetration and settlement, and it is Eckert's particular grace to be able to evoke life and meaning from the raw facts of this story. In The Frontiersmen not only do we care about our long-forgotten fathers, we live again with them. Researched for seven years, The Frontiersmen is the first in Mr. Eckert's ""The Winning of America"" series.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Westerns', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'War', 'Literature', 'American']"

The Quest for Christa T.,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153479.The_Quest_for_Christa_T_,"When The Quest for Christa T. was first published in East Germany in 1968, there was an immediate storm: bookshops in East Berlin were given instructions to sell it only to well-known customers professionally involved in literary matters; at the annual meeting of East German Writers Conference, Mrs Wolf's new book was condemmed. Yet the novel has nothing explicitly to do with politics.Praise for The Quest for Christa T.On the surface we merely have the story of a sensitive woman as recalled by her friend. On this level Christa T. was a good citizen who did as she was told and lived a seemingly unexceptional life. But between the lines lies the real story of Christa T. -- the story of an individual crushed by the pressures of uniformity. If you bear in mind it is the first novel of any consequence to emerge from Ulbricht's East Germany, then it becomes something of a literary landmark. - John Barkman,The contours of silence and the outline of things articulately left unsaid loom large in the muted brilliance of this novel. - Ernst Pawek,It is a courageous book that breaks taboos and, as we have come to expect from Christa Wolf, it is infused with an integrity and a deep moral concern. . . -","['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Germany', 'Classics', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Feminism', 'Literary Fiction', 'Womens']"
Getting Even,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55386.Getting_Even,"After three decades of prodigious film work & some unfortunate tabloid adventures, it's easy to forget that Woody Allen began his career as one heck of a great comedy writer. Getting Even, a collection of his late '60s magazine pieces, offers a look into Allen's bag of shtick, back when it was new. From the supposed memoirs of Hitler's barber: ""Then, in January of '45, a plot by several generals to shave Hitler's moustache in his sleep failed when von Stauffenberg, in the darkness of Hitler's bedroom, shaved off one of the Führer's eyebrows instead..."" Even tho the idea of writing jokes about old Adolf--or addled rabbis, or Maatjes herring--isn't nearly as fresh as it used to be, Getting Even still delivers plenty of laughs. At his best, Woody can achieve a level of transcendent craziness that no other writer can match. If you're looking for a book to dip into at random, or a gift for someone who's seen Sleeper 13 times, Getting Even is a classic, with 316,000 copies sold to date.","['Humor', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Comedy', 'Essays', 'American', 'Literature', 'Audiobook', 'The United States Of America', 'Philosophy']"

At some stage early in our lives we adopt a “position” about ourselves which very significantly determines how we feel about ourselves, particularly in relation to other people. And for a huge portion of the population, that position is that I’m Not OK-You’re OK. This negative Life Position, shared by successful and unsuccessful people alike, contaminates our rational adult potential, leaving us vulnerable to the inappropriate, emotional reactions of our child and the uncritically learned behavior programmed into our parent. By exploring the four basic “life positions,” we can radically change our lives.","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Relationships', 'Mental Health', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'How To']"

It would be unheard of for him to get married himself.

In the end, however, Zein’s ridiculous good luck augurs an ultimate reconciliation, opening a prospect of a world made whole.

Debunking what were accepted truths about the Second World War, he argued provocatively that Hitler did not set out to cause the war as part of an evil master plan, but blundered into it partly by accident, aided by the shortcomings of others. Fiercely attacked for vindicating Hitler, A.J.P. Taylor's stringent re-examination of the events preceding the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1st September 1939 opened up new debate, and is now recognized as a brilliant and classic piece of scholarly research.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'Military Fiction', 'European History', 'Military History', 'Germany', 'The World']"

During his lifetime, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize three times and had seen almost all of his major novels appear inEnglish.

Each story has its own distinctive atmosphere and each is brilliantly organized, yielding deeper layers of meaning with repeated readings. The psychologicalobservation, particularly in what it reveals of the turmoil of adolescence, is meticulous.The style, with its skillful blending of colors and surfaces, shows Mishima in top form, and no further proof is needed to remind us that he was a consummate writer whose work is an irreplaceable part of world literature.","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Japanese Literature', 'Japan', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Asia', 'Short Story Collection', 'Asian Literature', 'Literary Fiction']"

It should come as no surprise if a decade or so hence How It Is is appraised as a masterpiece of modern literature. This poetic novel is Beckett at his height.” — Webster Schott“A wonderful book, written in the sparest prose. . . . Beckett is one of the rare creative minds in our times.” — Alan Pryce-Jones“What is novel is the absolute sureness of design. . . built phrase by phrase into a beautifully and tightly wrought structure — a few dozen expressions permuted with deliberate redundancy accumulate meaning even as they are emptied of it, and offer themselves as points of radiation in a strange web of utter illusion.” — Hugh Kenner","['Fiction', 'Irish Literature', 'Ireland', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Nobel Prize', 'France', '20th Century']"

THE REAL HISTORY?It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world. It was included on School Library Journal’s list of One Hundred Books That Shaped the Twentieth Century, and its assertion that a committed group of men and women can prevail against a powerful force is as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in 1964.","['Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult', 'Middle Grade', 'Historical Fiction', 'Humor', 'Classics', 'Juvenile', 'New York', 'School']"

Not an ordinary historical novel, but rather a poetic, highly informed essay, it forth, in rich prose, a host of memorable impressions -- of Revolutionary Paris, of Caribbean islands sweltering in the sunlight, and of the Revolutionary ideals which, transplanted to these islands, died in blood, sweat and a return to slavery and the old ways. Its chief protagonist is Victor Hugues, a historical figure, who is shown through the eyes of three fictional orphaned adolescents -- Carlos, Sofia, and their cousin Esteban, whom he dazzled at first meeting. Esteban follows Victor as he rises from baker's son and merchant to Revolutionary master of the Caribbean, but sickens eventually of bloodshed and of Victor's ruthless changing to fit shifting policies. Sofia, who loves Victor and joins him, is also finally sickened by the betrayal of Revolutionary ideals, and the changes power has made in Victor. Above its many modern political parallels, this story is powerful evocation of the mysterious evolution, decay and persistence of all human relations and ambitions.

"Memoirs, 1925-1950",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193461.Memoirs_1925_1950,"This book is the personal and professional record of one of America's most distinguished diplomats, George F. Kennan. On his graduation from Princeton in 1925, moved perhaps by the example of his distant cousin George Kennan, who wrote the classic work on Siberia, the younger George prepared to enter the Foreign Service. After a short exposure to diplomacy in Germany and on the Baltic Coast, the young consul felt so inadequate that he was about to resign. His career was salvaged when the State Department registered him as a student of Russian at the University of Berlin, and here he began to acquire his knowledge of and insight into the Russian character which were to serve him so well.It has been Mr. Kennan's destiny to be posted repeatedly at the threshold of crises. His fluency in Russian make him an indispensable member of Ambassador Bullitt's small staff which reopened the American Embassy in Moscow in 1933. He was an observer at Stalin's famous purge trials. He was in Prague when the Germans took over Czechoslovakia. When Hitler declared war on the United States, Mr. Kennan was in Berlin and was interned for six months. He was Harriman's right-hand man in Moscow from 1944 to 1946 during the strenuous war negotiations with the Kremlin. Throughout this long exposure to the agony of Europe, Mr. Kennan was evolving policies for dealing with the Russians and, after the end of the war, the Germans. His Russian policies he defined in a series of farsighted Position Papers, which were sent to the State Department and pigeonholed without comment. These historic papers have been released by the State Department and are published at the end of this volume.When he was recalled to Washington in 1946, Kennan came into his own as a positive force in American foreign policy. President Truman and Secretary Marshall gave him the scope which F.D.R. had denied him. Kennan played a formative part in the development and application of the Marshall Plan. He was sent to Japan to help reform our occupational policy. He drew up a blueprint for the peaceful settlement of Central Europe -- a settlement in which he strongly resisted the rearming of Germany with nuclear weapons.This long and detailed account of twenty-five years of diplomatic history is written with extraordinary eloquence and lucidity. Mr. Kennan's portraits of Stalin, William Bullitt, Alexander Kirk, Harry Hopkins, General Marshall, Ambassador Harriman and Charles Bohlen are superbly drawn. The generous excerpts from his journals reveal his sensitivity to human details and his skill at evoking scenes and incidents from his travels in many lands.Mr. Kennan never loses the overview. Transcending he personal encounters, the specific events and positions, are his clearly articulated principles for the just government of foreign affairs in a world for which, like it or not, we as Americans bear a major responsibility. This makes these memoirs the most important book Mr. Kennan has yet written.","['History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Politics', 'European History', 'Biography Memoir', 'International Relations', 'Autobiography']"

The Pill vs. the Springhill Mine Disaster,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117336.The_Pill_vs_the_Springhill_Mine_Disaster,"Brautigan's poetic style is often surreal, often tender, with touches of humor. The poems are written in clear, straightforward free verse. Here is an example of his style from ""The Chinese Checker Players"": ""When I was six years old/I played Chinese checkers/with a woman/who was ninety-three years old.""Recurrent themes in the book include love, sex, loss & loneliness. Incorporated throughout are an intriguing mix of pop & 'high' culture references: Jefferson Airplane, Ophelia, the New York Yankees, John Donne etc. The book often has an earthy flavor. He writes about such topics as his own penis or the smell of a fart. Some particularly memorable poems include the following:""All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace,"" a sci-fi vision of a ""cybernetic meadow""; the open-ended ""Karma Repair Kit: Items 1-4""; ""Discovery,"" a joyful poem about sexual intimacy; the surreal ""The Pumpkin Tide""; the funny, haiku-like ""November 3""; & ""A Good-Talking Candle,"" which invites readers into altered states of perception.Altho most of the poems are very short, there is one longer poem: the 9-part, 9-page ""the Galilee Hitch-hiker,"" which chronicles the surreal adventures of Baudelaire — among other experiences, he opens an unconventional hamburger stand in San Francisco.

Invited to visit Tarzan's African estate, they become lost in the jungle and are imprisoned by cannibals, from whom they escape. They are then reunited with their host, who introduces them to his pet lion, Jad-bal-ja. Subsequently, they become involved in an adventure involving exiles from the lost city of Opar, who have kidnapped Gretchen von Harben, the daughter of a missionary. The Tarzan Twins, like all well-behaved twins, were born on the same day and, although they were not as ""alike as two peas,"" still they resembled one another quite closely enough to fulfill that particular requirement of twinship; but even there they commenced breaking the rules that have been governing twins during the past several millions of years, for Dick had a shock of the blackest sort of black hair, while Doc's hair was the sunny hue of molasses candy. Their noses were alike, their blue eyes were alike; alike were their chins and their mouths. Perhaps Doc's eyes twinkled more and his mouth smiled more than Dick's for Dick did much of his twinkling and smiling inside and inside the boys were very much alike, indeed. It is simply staggering to discover what a boy can accomplish if he makes up his mind to it and so it was not long before Dick and Doc did excel in nearly all athletic sports and when it came to climbing trees -- well, Tarzan himself would have had no reason to be ashamed of them. Though their scholastic standing may have suffered a little in the following months of athletic effort, their muscles did not, and as vacation time approached, Dick and Doc had become as hard as nails and as active as a couple of manus, which you will know, if your education has not been neglected, is the ape-word for monkeys. Then it was that the big surprise came in a letter that Dick received from his mother. Tarzan of the Apes had invited them all to visit him and spend two months on his great African estate! The boys were so excited that they talked until three o'clock the next morning and flunked in all their classes that day.","['Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Action', 'Pulp', 'Young Adult', 'Animals', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']"

He is sent to Europe by the victorious rebel leader to rebuild his country’s diplomatic and financial status post-revolution, and is immediately thrown into the elite environment of Europe’s jet set society of international bankers and diplomats.Outwardly, Dax lives a life of privilege as one of the continent’s most sought-after, hedonistic playboys—wanted by men and women alike, but for very different reasons.

The long poems of Starting From San Francisco present a new, quieter, more profound aspect of the poet. His original lyricism and caustic humor have been confronted, as it were, with the real presence of evil and death. ""Starting from Paumanok... I strike up for a New World"" wrote Walt Whitman in 1860. Starting from San Francisco , a hundred years later, Ferlinghetti roved back across the country (this ""cradle we rocked out of"") then turned south of the border to visionary conclusions in that lost horizon symbolized by Machu Picchu, the Inca city the Spaniards never found. These poems of voyage are autobiographical in that they grew out of Ferlinghetti’s travels in South America and Europe, but there are also poems on other themes, including several long ""broadsides,"" which the author identifies as ""satirical tirades––poetry admittedly corrupted by the political, itself irradiated by the Thing it attacks."" Commenting on this paperbook edition, to which two important poems, ""Berlin"" and ""The Situation in The West"" have been added, Ferlinghetti ""These poems represent to me a kind of halfway house in the ascent of a mountain I hardly knew existed until I stopped and looked back at the flatlands below.

The book's first half, which includes the celebrated essay on Descartes and Foucault, shows the development of Derrida's method of deconstruction. In these essays, Derrida demonstrates the traditional nature of some purportedly nontraditional currents of modern thought—one of his main targets being the way in which ""structuralism"" unwittingly repeats metaphysical concepts in its use of linguistic models.The second half of the book contains some of Derrida's most compelling analyses of why and how metaphysical thinking must exclude writing from its conception of language, finally showing metaphysics to be constituted by this exclusion. These essays on Artaud, Freud, Bataille, Hegel, and Lévi-Strauss have served as introductions to Derrida's notions of writing and —the untranslatable formulation of a nonmetaphysical ""concept"" that does not exclude writing—for almost a generation of students of literature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis.reveals the unacknowledged program that makes thought itself possible. In analyzing the contradictions inherent in this program, Derrida goes on to develop new ways of thinking, reading, and writing,—new ways based on the most complete and rigorous understanding of the old ways. Scholars and students from all disciplines will find an excellent introduction to perhaps the most challenging of contemporary French thinkers—challenging because Derrida questions thought as we know it.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'France', 'Literary Criticism', 'Writing', 'Language', 'Academic', 'Essays', 'Linguistics']"

Man of La Mancha: A Musical Play,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632594.Man_of_La_Mancha,"Winner of the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Musical, 1966""To me the most interesting aspect of the success of Man of La Mancha is the fact that it plows squarely upstream against the prevailing current of philosophy in the theater. That current is best identified by its catch-labels--Theater of the Absurd, Black Comedy, the Theater of Cruelty--which is to say the theater of alienation, of moral anarchy and despair. To the practitioners of those philosophies Man of La Mancha must seem hopelessly naive in its espousal of illusion as man's strongest spiritual need, the most meaningful function of his imagination. But I've no unhappiness about that. ""Facts are the enemy of truth,"" says Cervantes-Don Quixote. And that is precisely what I felt and meant.""--Dale Wasserman, from the Preface.","['Plays', 'Theatre', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Musicals', 'Humor', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'School', 'Romance']"

Otra vez, frente a este proxeneta con rasgos místicos -Larsen-, canalla con tanto de hundido como de salvado; frente a esta ciudad inexistente en la realidad pero verdadera, de ficción pero no de juguete, podemos caer en la tentación de felicitar a Onetti por presentar un pedazo descarnado de latinoamérica, sin exotismo ni prodigios, sin utilizar la impotencia y la erosión para exportar como un folclore alegre y vendible. Pero cualquier habitante de Europa del Este, de los años 30 o de los posteriores a la segunda guerra, podría encontrar en esta ciudad catastrófica tantos factores en común como un latinoamericano o un norteamericano de una desolada ciudad del sur.

Η νυχτερίδα,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9531613,"Οι ""Ακυβέρνητες Πολιτείες"" απαρτίζονται από τρεις τόμους: ""Η λέσχη"" (1961), ""Αριάγνη"" (1962), ""Η νυχτερίδα"" (1965). Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης. Ιστορική ακρίβεια και φαντασία σπάνια δένονται σ' ένα τόσο αρμονικό σύνολο. Κινώντας στιβαρά μεγάλους όγκους, καταγράφει ευαίσθητα τις απηχήσεις των γεγονότων στη συνείδηση και στις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων, πλάθοντας ολοζώντανες μορφές που θα μείνουν στο πάνθεον των μυθιστορηματικών ηρώων. Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση.

Sun & Steel,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62804.Sun_Steel,"In this fascinating document, one of Japan's best known-and controversial-writers created what might be termed a new literary form. It is new because it combines elements of many existing types of writing, yet in the end fits into none of them.At one level, it may be read as an account of how a puny, bookish boy discovered the importance of his own physical being; the ""sun and steel"" of the title are themselves symbols respectively of the cult of the open air and the weights used in bodybuilding. At another level, it is a discussion by a major novelist of the relation between action and art, and his own highly polished art in particular. More personally, it is an account of one individual's search for identity and self-integration. Or again, the work could be seen as a demonstration of how an intensely individual preoccupation can be developed into a profound philosophy of life.All these elements are woven together by Mishima's complex yet polished and supple style. The confession and the self-analysis, the philosophy and the poetry combine in the end to create something that is in itself perfect and self-sufficient. It is a piece of literature that is as carefully fashioned as Mishima's novels, and at the same time provides an indispensable key to the understanding of them as art.The road Mishima took to salvation is a highly personal one. Yet here, ultimately, one detects the unmistakable tones of a self transcending the particular and attaining to a poetic vision of the universal. The book is therefore a moving document, and is highly significant as a pointer to the future development of one of the most interesting novelists of modern times.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography', 'Essays', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Asian Literature']"

Il suo presente è il tempo che segue la fuga, senza sapere cosa si è lasciato alle spalle: non gli resta che rifugiarsi nella scrittura e nell'attesa di Line, una donna immaginaria.Il giorno in cui Line arriva, sarà come il materializzarsi di un ricordo: lei emerge dal passato è la sua sorellastra, la sua ossessione di sempre. La nostalgia si mescola alla curiosità di sapere, la complicità sfocia in un amore impossibile. Potrebbe essere l'inizio di un futuro diverso, ma quella di Line e Tobias è una storia che non si può lasciare alle spalle.","['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Hungary', 'Hungarian Literature', 'France', 'Literature', 'Novella', 'Contemporary', 'French Literature', '20th Century']"

A Boy and His Dog,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30286680-a-boy-and-his-dog,"Winner of the Nebula Award: A boy and his telepathic dog fight to survive in a war-torn, postapocalyptic world in this hard-hitting science fiction novella. In an alternate world in which John F. Kennedy survived and scientific breakthroughs in animal research and telepathy allow for advanced communication with animal companions, fifteen-year-old Vic and his telepathic dog, Blood, scavenge the wastelands of a war-torn United States, survivors of a nuclear World War III between the Americans and the Soviets. While Blood guides Vic toward women—to be used for sex—Vic ensures that Blood has food, but the symbiotic relationship is put at risk when the pair meets Quilla June Holmes, who lures the boy to an underground civilization. A piece of shocking, dystopic science fiction, questions the boundaries and nature of love while crafting a vision of a dark future guaranteed to leave chills. Also included here is “Ahbhu: The Passing of One Man’s Inspiration and Best Friend,” a personal essay by author Harlan Ellison, which lovingly recounts the life of his canine companion, Ahbhu, the true-life basis for Blood. Ellison recalls rescuing Ahbhu from the West Los Angeles Animal Shelter and gives a brief chronicle of life with his furry friend, whom he stresses was both “a person” and “impossible to anthropomorphize.” The nostalgic in memoriam frames the author’s relationship with animals while casting a personal light on the inspiration for the novella with which it is paired. Winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novella and a Hugo Award finalist, was adapted into a cult classic film and fully solidifies Ellison as a master of his craft. This volume combines a dark, dystopian future of animal telepathy, sex, and postapocalyptic underworlds with a real-life account of the author’s muse for the feisty but loyal Blood. Indispensible reading material for any fan of Ellison or dark science fiction, animal lovers will also delight over the relationship between Vic and Blood.

SCUM Manifesto,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52263.SCUM_Manifesto,"SCUM Manifesto was considered one of the most outrageous, violent and certifiably crazy tracts when it first appeared in 1968.

But the Manifesto, for all its vitriol, is impossible to dismiss as just the rantings of a lesbian lunatic. In fact, the work has indisputable prescience, not only as a radical feminist analysis light-years ahead of its timepredicting artificial insemination, ATMs, a feminist uprising against under-representation in the artsbut also as a stunning testament to the rage of an abused and destitute woman.The focus of this edition is not on the nostalgic appeal of the work, but on Avital Ronell’s incisive introduction, “Deviant The Aims of Valerie Solanas.” Here is a reconsideration of Solanas’s infamous text in light of her social milieu, Derrida’s “The Ends of Man” (written in the same year), Judith Butler’s Excitable Speech , Nietzsche’s Ubermensch and notorious feminist icons from Medusa, Medea and Antigone, to Lizzie Borden, Lorenna Bobbit and Aileen Wournos, illuminating the evocative exuberance of Solanas’s dark tract.","['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Gender', 'Classics', 'Womens', 'Queer', 'Theory']"

The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107971.The_Birth_of_the_Clinic,"Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found here.In the eighteenth century, medicine underwent a mutation. For the first time, medical knowledge took on a precision that had formerly belonged only to mathematics. The body became something that could be mapped. Disease became subject to new rules of classification. And doctors begin to describe phenomena that for centuries had remained below the threshold of the visible and expressible.In the philosopher and intellectual historian who may be the true heir to Nietzsche charts this dramatic transformation of medical knowledge. As in his classic Madness and Civilization, Michel Foucault shows how much what we think of as pure science owes to social and cultural attitudes — in this case, to the climate of the French Revolution. Brilliant, provocative, and omnivorously learned, his book sheds new light on the origins of our current notions of health and sickness, life and death.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theory', 'Medicine', 'Sociology', 'Anthropology', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Medical']"

The Day of St. Anthony's Fire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3058370-the-day-of-st-anthony-s-fire,"This is the strange, true, almost incredible story of a small French village where in '51 hundreds of townspeople went mad on a single night. Many of the most highly regarded citizens leaped from windows or jumped into the Rhone, screaming that their heads were made of copper, their bodies wrapped in snakes, their limbs swollen to gigantic size or shrunken to tiny appendages. Others ran through the streets, claiming to be chased by ""bandits with donkey ears"", by tigers, lions & other terrifying apparitions. Animals went berserk. Dogs ripped bark from trees until their teeth fell out. Cats dragged themselves along the floor in grotesque contortions. Ducks strutted like penguins. Villagers & animals died right & left.Bit by bit, the story behind the tragedy in Pont-St-Esprit--a tiny Provencial village of twisted streets that looks much today as it did in the Middle Ages--unfolded to doctors & toxcologists. That story, one of the most bizarre in modern medical history, is movingly recounted in .Throughout the Middle Ages & during other times in history, similar hallucinatory outbreaks occurred. They were called St. Anthony's Fire because it was believed that only prayers to the saint could hold the disease in check.Even modern medicine could find no way to check the disease. Drugs failed to bring even temporary relief. Hundreds in the village suffered for weeks, with total agonizing insomnia, never knowing when they might once more suddenly go berserk.The cause of St. Anthony's Fire was known since early history to be ergot, a mold found on rye grain that at rare times inexplicably became posionous enough to create monstrous hallucinations & death. In '51 little significance was attached to the fact that the base of ergot was lysergic acid, also the base for LSD, a drug just coming to the attention of scientists at the time--a drug so powerful that one eye-dropperful could cause as many as 5000 people to hallucinate for hours. At this point, the story becomes a vividly absorbing medical detective story demonstrating the possibility that a strange, spontaneous form of LSD might have caused the human tragedy that came to the hapless villagers of Pont-St-Esprit.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Science', 'True Crime', 'Mystery', 'Politics', 'Horror', 'France']"
Great Siege: Malta 1565,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/371301.Great_Siege,"In 1565 the Ottoman Empire was at its peak. Under their sultan, Solyman the Magnificent, the Turks had conquered most of Eastern Europe. The rulers of Christian Europe were at their wits' end to stem the tide of disaster. The Knights of St John, the fighting religious order drawn from most of the nations of Christendom had been driven from their island fortress of Rhodes 40 years earlier. From their new base of Malta their galleys had been so successful in their raids on Turkish shipping that the Sultan realised that only they stood between him and total mastery of the Mediterranean. He determined to obliterate the Knights of Malta. This reconstruction of the Siege of Malta brings history alive, and carries the reader through many battles, the heroism and the hunger to the relief which came, nearly too late, and the final victory.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Historical', 'European History', 'Audiobook', 'Medieval', 'Islam']"
Why We Can't Wait,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160939.Why_We_Can_t_Wait,"Dr. Martin Luther King’s classic exploration of the events and forces behind the Civil Rights Movement—including his Letter from Birmingham Jail, April 16, 1963.“There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.”In 1963, Birmingham, Alabama, was perhaps the most racially segregated city in the United States. The campaign launched by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Civil Rights movement on the segregated streets of Birmingham demonstrated to the world the power of nonviolent direct action.In this remarkable book—winner of the Nobel Peace Prize—Dr. King recounts the story of Birmingham in vivid detail, tracing the history of the struggle for civil rights back to its beginnings three centuries ago and looking to the future, assessing the work to be done beyond Birmingham to bring about full equality for African Americans. Above all, Dr. King offers an eloquent and penetrating analysis of the events and pressures that propelled the Civil Rights movement from lunch counter sit-ins and prayer marches to the forefront of American consciousness.Since its publication in the 1960s, has become an indisputable classic. Now, more than ever, it is an enduring testament to the wise and courageous vision of Martin Luther King, Jr.Includes photographs and an afterword by Reverend Jesse L.

The Death of a President: November 1963,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1106474.The_Death_of_a_President,"On a lovely October evening in 1961 President Kennedy and William Manchester sat in the Oval Room of the White House, talking for three and a half hours. At first the discussion was detached; Mr. Manchester was writing his Portrait of a President. But soon they were conversing as two men do who have lived many of the same years in the same places. Both were natives of Massachusetts. As a World War II Marine on Guadalcanal, Manchester had been separated by only a narrow strait from Kennedy's PT-109 base on Tulagi. They had both been awarded Purple Hearts before leaving the Pacific. Now they were fathers of daughters the same age, had traveled in the same foreign countries, and shared a deep interest in American history.More than two years later, following the assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy realized that she and others would be obliged to share their recollections of the national tragedy with a responsible writer--and so she and Senator Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Manchester to set down a history of the assassination and the days immediately preceding and following it.At the invitation of the Chief Justice, Mr. Manchester was a privileged observer of the Warren Commission inquiry. Meanwhile, however, he had developed his own sources of information. Operating out of headquarters in the National Archives, for two years he worked twelve to fifteen hours a day, conducting a major historical investigation throughout Texas and elsewhere, accumulating forty-five volumes and portfolios of transcribed tapes, shorthand, documents and exhibits, all of which will be deposited in the Kennedy Library. Finally, in New England, he completed a 350,000-word manuscript, not for scrutiny by the family but to set down as a whole the national and personal tragedy.The result is a powerful narrative which, in the opinion of the publisher, is both a significant contribution to history and an eminent literary achievement.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Biography', 'Presidents', 'True Crime', 'Us Presidents', 'Historical', 'American']"

From a poor family and without formal education, Ettie has devoted her life to the cause of her husband, Vince, a courageous magistrate who had been blacklisted for political reasons before the war. Iza, their daughter, is as brave and conscientious as her father: Active in the resistance against the Nazis, she is now a doctor and a force for progress. Iza lives and works in Budapest, and when Vince dies, she is quick to bring Ettie to the city to make sure her mother is close and can be cared for. She means to do everything right, and Ettie is eager to do everything to the satisfaction of the daughter she is so proud of. But good intentions aside, mother and daughter come from two different worlds and have different ideas of what it means to lead a good life. Though they struggle to accommodate each other, increasingly they misunderstand and hurt each other, and the distance between them widens into an abyss. . . .","['Fiction', 'Hungary', 'Classics', 'Hungarian Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Family', 'Womens', 'European Literature']"

"Miss MacIntosh, My Darling",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4101908-miss-macintosh-my-darling,"This novel is one of the most ambitious and remarkable literary achievements of our time. It is a picaresque, psychological novel--a novel of the road, a journey or voyage of the human spirit in its search for reality in a world of illusion and nightmare. It is an epic of what might be called the Arabian Nights of American life. Marguerite Young's method is poetic, imagistic, incantatory; in prose of extraordinary richness she tests the nature of her characters--and the nature of reality. Miss MacIntosh, My Darling is written with oceanic music moving at many levels of consciousness and perception; but the toughly fibred realistic fabric is always there, in the happenings of the narrative, the humor, the precise details, the definitions of the characters. Miss MacIntosh herself, who hails from What Cheer, Iowa, and seems downright and normal, with an incorruptible sense of humor and the desire to put an end to phantoms; Catherine Cartwheel, the opium lady, a recluse who is shut away in a great New England seaside house and entertains imaginary guests; Mr. Spitzer, the lawyer, musical composer and mystical space traveler, a gentle man, wholly unsure of himself and of reality; his twin brother Peron, the gay and raffish gambler and virtuoso in the world of sports; Cousin Hannah, the horsewoman, balloonist, mountain-climber and militant Boston feminist, known as Al Hamad through all the seraglios of the East; Titus Bonebreaker of Chicago, wild man of God dreaming of a heavenly crown; the very efficient Christian hangman, Mr. Weed of the Wabash River Valley; a featherweight champion who meets his equal in a graveyard--these are a few who live with phantasmagorical vividness in the pages of Miss MacIntosh, My Darling. The novel touches on many aspects of life--drug addiction, woman's suffrage, murder, suicide, pregnancy both real and imaginary, schizophrenia, many strange loves, the psychology of gambling, perfectionism; but the profusion of this huge book serves always to intensify the force of the central question: ""What shall we do when, fleeing from illusion, we are confronted by illusion?"" What is real, what is dream? Is the calendar of the human heart the same as that kept by the earth? Is it possible that one may live a secondary life of which one does not know? In every aspect, Miss MacIntosh, My Darling stands by itself--in the lyric beauty of its prose, its imaginative vitality and cumulative emotional power. It is the work of a writer of genius.""This is a search for reality through a maze of illusions and fantasy and dreams, ultimately asserting in the words of Calderon: 'Life is a dream.'"" - Anais Nin""Marguerite Young is unquestionably a genius."" - Kurt Vonnegut""A work of stunning magnitude and beauty. . . . The book's mysterious readability is effected through enchantment and hypnosis. Its force is cumulative; its method is amassment, as in the great styles of Joyce or Hermann Broch or Melville or Faulkner. . . . One of the most arresting literary achievements in our last 20 years. . . . It is a masterwork."" - William Goyen, New York Times Book Review, 9/12/65""An extraordinary book by a woman possessed of a breathtaking verbal virtuosity. She also has quality of heart. . . . There are times when her pages surge and beat on the heart and imagination like great music; other times when it shimmers motionless like an ancient Hindu painting."" - Lillian Smith, Chicago Tribune""The prose is lyric, striking and memorable."" - Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World, 3/21/93This encyclopedic novel addresses the question of illusion, as Young--whose epic vision and exquisite prose are truly awesome--dissects the essence of reality and ruminates on where it can be found."" - L.A.

Tiempo de silencio,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1357327.Tiempo_de_silencio,"La primera edición de Tiempo de silencio apareció en Biblioteca Formentor, Seix Barral, en 1961 y alcanzó casi inmediatamente una extraordinaria resonancia crítica.

Never Call Retreat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7093.Never_Call_Retreat,"The final volume of Bruce Catton's monumental Centennial History of the Civil War traces the war from Fredericksburg through the succeeding grim and relentless campaigns to the Courthouse at Appomattox and the death of Lincoln.This is an eloquent study of the bitterest years of the war when death slashed the country with a brutality unparalleled in the history of the United States. Through the kaleidoscope tone and temper of the struggle, two men, different in stature, but similar in dedication to their awesome tasks, grappled with the burden of being leaders both in politics and war. In the north Lincoln remained resolute in the belief that a house divided against itself could not stand. His determination and uncanny vision of the destiny of the country and its people far transcended the plaguing tensions, fears, and frustrations of his cabinet and Congress. Mr. Lincoln’s use of vast resources is brilliantly contrasted to Davis’s valiant struggle for political and economic stability in a hopelessly fragmented and underdeveloped south. Though Davis never lacked for spirit and dedication, his handicaps were severe. This was not a war to be won by static ideals and romanticism. As Mr. Lincoln managed to expand and intensify the ideals that sustained the Northern war effort, Mr. Davis was never able to enlarge the South’s. This was a war to be won by flexibility in though, strength in supplies, and battles. And so they were fought––Fredericksburg, The Wilderness, Chancellorsville, Vicksburg, Gettysburg.","['History', 'Civil War', 'American Civil War', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Military History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Civil War History', 'American']"

The Theatre of the Absurd,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359954.The_Theatre_of_the_Absurd,"In 1953, Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot premiered at a tiny avant-garde theatre in Paris; within five years, it had been translated into more than twenty languages and seen by more than a million spectators. Its startling popularity marked the emergence of a new type of theatre whose proponents—Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter, and others—shattered dramatic conventions and paid scant attention to psychological realism, while highlighting their characters’ inability to understand one another. In 1961, Martin Esslin gave a name to the phenomenon in his groundbreaking study of these playwrights who dramatized the absurdity at the core of the human condition.Over four decades after its initial publication, Esslin’s landmark book has lost none of its freshness. The questions these dramatists raise about the struggle for meaning in a purposeless world are still as incisive and necessary today as they were when Beckett’s tramps first waited beneath a dying tree on a lonely country road for a mysterious benefactor who would never show. Authoritative, engaging, and eminently readable, The Theatre of the Absurd is nothing short of a vital reading for anyone with an interest in the theatre.","['Theatre', 'Nonfiction', 'Drama', 'Plays', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Literary Criticism', 'Art', 'History', 'Reference']"

First, he describes how the war slowly but steadily got out of control. This would not be the neat, short, “limited” war both sides had envisioned. And then the author reveals how the sweeping force of all-out conflict changed the war’s purpose, in turning it into a war for human freedom.It was not initially a war against slavery. Instead, this was, Mr. Lincoln kept insisting, a fight to reunite the United States. At first, it was not even much of a fight. Cautious generals; inexperienced, incompetent, or jealous administrators; shortages of good people and supplies; excess of both gloom and optimism, kept each side from swinging into decisive action. As the buildup began, there were maddening delays. The earliest engagements were halting and inconclusive. After these first tests at arms, reputations began to crumble. Buell, Halleck, Beauregard Albert Sidney Johnston. Failed to drive ahead—for reasons good and bad. General McClellan (impaled in these pages on the arrogant words of his letters) captured more imaginations than enemies, and continued to accept serious over estimates of Confederate strength while becoming more and more fatally estranged from his own government.","['History', 'Civil War', 'Nonfiction', 'American Civil War', 'American History', 'Military History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Civil War History', 'American']"

Rabelais and His World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/642914.Rabelais_and_His_World,"This classic work by the Russian philosopher and literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895—1975) examines popular humor and folk culture in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, especially the world of carnival, as depicted in the novels of François Rabelais. In Bakhtin's view, the spirit of laughter and irreverence prevailing at carnival time is the dominant quality of Rabelais's art. The work of both Rabelais and Bakhtin springs from an age of revolution, and each reflects a particularly open sense of the literary text. For both, carnival, with its emphasis on the earthly and the grotesque, signified the symbolic destruction of authority and official culture and the assertion of popular renewal. Bakhtin evokes carnival as a special, creative life form, with its own space and time.Written in the Soviet Union in the 1930s at the height of the era but published there for the first time only in 1965, Bakhtin's book is both a major contribution to the poetics of the novel and a subtle condemnation of the degeneration of the Russian revolution into Stalinist orthodoxy. One of the essential texts of a theorist who is rapidly becoming a major reference in contemporary thought, is essential reading for anyone interested in problems of language and text and in cultural interpretation.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theory', 'Literary Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Russia', 'Literature', 'Medieval', 'Cultural']"

He draws a curtain to reveal a painting of a woman, explaining that it is a portrait of his late wife; he invites his guest to sit and look at the painting.Robert Browning (1812 - 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of dramatic verse, and in particular the dramatic monologue, made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. His poems are known for their irony, characterization, dark humor, social commentary, historical settings, and challenging vocabulary and syntax. The speakers in his poems are often musicians or painters whose work functions as a metaphor for poetry.","['Poetry', 'Classics', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Victorian', '19th Century', 'Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction']"

Η λέσχη,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9531577,"Οι ""Ακυβέρνητες πολιτείες"" απαρτίζονται από τρεις τόμους: ""Η λέσχη"" (1961), ""Αριάγνη"" (1962), ""Η νυχτερίδα"" (1965). Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης.

Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση.

In these three tales, superbly translated by Edward Seidensticker, erotic fantasy is underlaid with longing and memories of past loves.In the title story, the protagonist visits a brothel where elderly men spend a chaste but lecherous night with a drugged, unconscious virgin. As he admires the girl's beauty, he recalls his past womanizing, and reflects on the relentless course of old age.In One Arm, a young girl removes her right arm and gives it to the narrator to take home for the night; a surreal seduction follows as he tries to allay its fears, caresses it, and even replaces his own right arm with it.The protagonist of Of Birds and Beasts prefers the company of his pet birds and dogs to people, yet for him all living beings are beautiful objects which, though they give him pleasure, he treats with casual cruelty.Beautiful yet chilling, richly poetic yet subtly disturbing, these stories make compelling reading and reaffirm Kawabata s status as a world-class writer.","['Fiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Asian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Asia']"

Aries traces the evolution of the concept of childhood from the end of the Middle Ages, when the child was regarded as a small adult, to the present child-centered society, by means of diaries, paintings, games, and school curricula. Ironically, he finds that individualism, far from triumphing in our time, has been held in check by the family, and that the increasing power of the tightly-knit family circle has flourished at the expense of the rich-textured communal society of earlier times.

People greet each other with “goodbye,” blow smoke into cigarettes, and rise from the dead. When one of those rising dead is the famous and powerful prophet Anarch Peak, a number of groups start a mad scramble to find him first—but their motives are not exactly benevolent, because Anarch Peak may just be worth more dead than alive, and these groups will do whatever they must to send him back to the grave.What would you do if your long-dead relatives started coming back? Who would take care of them? And what if they preferred being dead? In Counter-Clock World, these troubling questions are addressed; though, as always, you may have to figure out the answers yourself.“Dick is the American writer who in recent years has most influenced non-American poets, novelists, and essayists.”—Roberto Bolaño","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Religion', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'American']"

Powell first arrived at the servants' entrance of one of those great houses in the 1920s. As a kitchen maid - the lowest of the low - she entered an entirely new world; one of stoves to be blacked, vegetables to be scrubbed, mistresses to be appeased, and bootlaces to be ironed. Work started at 5:30am and went on until after dark. It was a far cry from her childhood on the beaches of Hove, where money and food were scarce, but warmth and laughter never were. Yet from the gentleman with a penchant for stroking the housemaids' curlers, to raucous tea-dances with errand boys, to the heartbreaking story of Agnes the pregnant under-parlormaid, fired for being seduced by her mistress's nephew, Margaret's tales of her time in service are told with wit, warmth, and a sharp eye for the prejudices of her situation. Margaret Powell's true story of a life spent in service is a fascinating ""downstairs"" portrait of the glittering, long-gone worlds behind the closed doors of Downton Abbey and 165 Eaton Place.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Autobiography', 'Adult', 'Food']"

The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/403690.The_Sense_of_an_Ending,"s/t: With a New EpilogueFrank Kermode is one of our most distinguished and beloved critics of English literature. Here, he contributes a new epilogue to his collection of classic lectures on the relationship of fiction to age-old concepts of apocalyptic chaos and crisis. Prompted by the approach of the millennium, he revisits the book which brings his highly concentrated insights to bear on some of the most unyielding philosophical and aesthetic enigmas. Examining the works of writers from Plato to William Burrows, Kermode shows how they have persistently imposed their ""fictions"" upon the face of eternity and how these have reflected the apocalyptic spirit. Kermode then discusses literature at a time when new fictive explanations, as used by Spenser and Shakespeare, were being devised to fit a world of uncertain beginning and end. He goes on to deal perceptively with modern literaturewith ""traditionalists"" such as Yeats, Eliot, and Joyce, as well as contemporary ""schismatics,"" the French ""new novelists,"" and such seminal figures as Jean-Paul Sartre and Samuel Beckett. Whether weighing the difference between modern and earlier modes of apocalyptic thought, considering the degeneration of fiction into myth, or commenting on the vogue of the Absurd, Kermode is distinctly lucid, persuasive, witty, and prodigal of ideas.","['Nonfiction', 'Literary Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Writing', 'Literature', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', '20th Century', 'History']"

En la novela, el medio geográfico y social parece determinar de modo decisivo el ser y el existir de sus criaturas; el destino parece jugar con esos personajes, pobres lugareños aferrados al terruño, vivos y elementales, que defienden rabiosamente su libertad y constituyen un retablo de cruda y palpitante humanidad. Entre ellos surge poderosamente la figura del Ratero, y sobre todo la del Nini, niño que vive sufriendo e intenta rebelarse contra la sordidez que le rodea; pero su rebeldía es callada, dulce, sin vanidad, y le levanta a la altura de símbolo: el bien contra el mal, el candor contra la astucia... El drama sera inevitable, pero la tragedia —ha dicho un crítico— «está contada de la manera sencilla con que las tragedias se abaten sobre el hombre en la vida: sin demasía, sin melodrama, sin aspavientos».","['Fiction', 'Spanish Literature', 'Classics', 'Spain', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Drama']"

But, at the same time, his substantive concern was the structure of class struggle and the fate of mass movements of popular revolt, from the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century to the Russian and Chinese revolutions in the twentieth: their ascent, stabilisation, petrification and decline, in a world still overwhelmingly dominated by scarcity.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Politics', 'History', 'France']"

The birds. The Twelve Days of Christmas theme. Remember?"" Uncle Willie did remember, but even he didn't foresee just how hopelessly (and riotously) entangled biology and merchandising could become.Though The Christmas Bower is an allegory in a a way, all the science part of the book is real. It is the only known work of ornithological science fiction, full of quips and quibbles, and is especially recommended for reading aloud by the whole family.",['Fiction']

Preface to Plato,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181001.Preface_to_Plato,"Plato's frontal attack on poetry has always been a problem for sympathetic students, who have often minimized or avoided it. Beginning with the premise that the attack must be taken seriously, Eric Havelock shows that Plato's hostility is explained by the continued domination of the poetic tradition in contemporary Greek thought.The reason for the dominance of this tradition was technological. In a nonliterate culture, stored experience necessary to cultural stability had to be preserved as poetry in order to be memorized. Plato attacks poets, particularly Homer, as the sole source of Greek moral and technical instruction--Mr. Havelock shows how the acted as an oral encyclopedia. Under the label of mimesis, Plato condemns the poetic process of emotional identification and the necessity of presenting content as a series of specific images in a continued narrative.The second part of the book discusses the Platonic Forms as an aspect of an increasingly rational culture. Literate Greece demanded, instead of poetic discourse, a vocabulary and a sentence structure both abstract and explicit in which experience could be described normatively and analytically: in short a language of ethics and science.","['Philosophy', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'Politics', 'Science', 'Art', 'Psychology', 'Greece']"

This collection mines their pages to bring out some of his essential lessons and to showcase the themes that provided the foundation for his The Nature of Man, The Moral World, Sin, The Christian Commitment, Love and Sex, Hell and Heaven, and others.

Sexual Politics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257649.Sexual_Politics,"""Praised and denounced when it was first published in 1970, ""Sexual Politics"" not only explored history but also became part of it. Kate Millett's groundbreaking book fueled feminism's second wave, giving voice to the anger of a generation while documenting the inequities - neatly packaged in revered works of literature and art - of a complacent and unrepentant society. ""Sexual Politics"" laid the foundation for subsequent feminist scholarship by showing how cultural discourse reflects a systematized subjugation and exploitation of women. Identifying patriarchy as a socially conditioned belief system masquerading as nature, Millett demonstrates in detail how its attitudes and systems penetrate literature, philosophy, psychology, and politics. Her incendiary work rocked the foundations of the literary canon by castigating time-honored classics - from D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's ""Lover"" to Norman Mailer's ""The Naked and the Dead"" - for their use of sex to degrade and undermine women. A new introduction to this edition draws attention to some of the forms patriarchy has taken recently in consolidating its oppressive and dangerous control.""","['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Gender', 'Womens', 'Gender Studies', 'Sexuality', 'Theory', 'Sociology']"

News of a Kidnapping,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16251.News_of_a_Kidnapping,"THIS ASTONISHING BOOK by the Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez chronicles the 1990 kidnappings of ten Colombian man and women--all journalists but one--by the Medellín drug boss Pablo Escobar. The carefully orchestrated abductions were Escobar's attempt to extort from the government its assurance that he, and other narcotics traffickers, would not be extradited to the United States if they were to surrender.From the highest corridors of government to the domain of the ruthless drug cartels, we watch the unfolding of a bizarre drama replete with fascinating characters Cesar Gaviria, the nation's cool and secretive president; Diana Turbay, a famous television journalist and magazine editor; three indomitable women who are imprisoned for miserable months in a small room with a light perpetually on; an eighty-two-year-old priest with a mission to bring the regime and the cartel to the negotiating table; and Escobar himself, the legendary drug baron who changes his bodyguards daily and maintains a private zoo with giraffes and hippos from Africa.All of this takes place in a country where presidential candidates and cabinet officers are routinely assassinated; where police go into the Medellín slums to murder boys they think may be working for Escobar; but where brave and honest citizens are trying desperately to make democracy survive.An international best-seller, News of a Kidnapping combines journalistic tenacity with the breathtaking language and perception that distinguish the writings of Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez. It draws us unto into a world that, like some phantasmagorical setting in a great Garcí­a Márquez novel, we can scarcely believe exists--but that continually shocks us with its cold, hard reality.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Spanish Literature', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Journalism', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'Politics', 'Nobel Prize']"

A presente antologia - agora em sexta edição - já consagrada como a mais representativa transcriação em língua português e comparável às melhores traduções internacionais, desenvolve um traçado sintético da evolução da obra maiakovskiana, no que diz respeito às formas tomadas por sua linguagem, documentando todas as fases deste percurso, desde as primícias do poeta até os últimos versos que escreveu encontrados após o seu suicídio.","['Poetry', 'Russia']"
Dark Piper,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1183898.Dark_Piper,"Returning home after ten years, Griss Lugard found Beltane relatively untouched by the annihilating war of the Four Sectors, her inhabitants still immersed in the biological researches on mutation for which the planet had been designated. The destruction of the other worlds in the Confederation meant little to them, nor would they listen to Lugard's warnings of danger from the lawless elements roaming the chaotic off-world.Only Vere Collis and his nine young friends believed in Lugard and, drawn by his magnetism and his promises of exploring unknown desert caves, were safe underground when a series of explosions rocked Beltane, killing Lugard and sealing them in. In the days that followed, the small group battled fear and despair, as well as enemies more tangible, until they won their way to the surface, there to receive a shattering blow: all other human inhabitants on Beltane had perished. Only strange and possibly hostile mutant creatures remained.Rich in adventure and excitement, Dark Piper once more displays the superlative imagination and narrative skill that have put Andre Norton among the top writers of science fiction.","['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Space Opera', 'Collections', 'Adult']"

Bring Larks and Heroes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12905026-bring-larks-and-heroes,"""This outstanding novel is set in a remote British penal colony, late in the 1790s. Thomas Keneally's evocative writing gives us searing insight into the sun-parched settlements of hungry transports and corruptive soldiers. But this is not an 'historical' novel in the usual sense. It is the story of a man, Corporal Phelim Halloran, and of the demands made on him - by his girl, his Irish comrades, his superior officers, and, most often, by his conscience.Innocent and lover, poet, soldier-by-accident, scholar by the standards of his day, Halloran attempts to make a world unto himself. through his pity and love for Ann Rush, his 'secret bride'; but many seem pledged to complicate these simple desires. There is the convict-artist, Thomas Ewers, persecuted and compelled to illustrate the officers' journals. There is Halloran's feckless colleague, Terry Byrne. The convict, Quinn, whose term of imprisonment should have been nearly over. Robert Hearne, political prisoner, government clerk and traitor. Halloran comes to disbelieve in any other existence except his own and God's, until, shockingly and irrevocably, he is reunited with Ann.""","['Australia', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', '20th Century']"
The Concept of Law,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385508.The_Concept_of_Law,"The Concept of Law is the most important and original work of legal philosophy written this century. First published in 1961, it is considered the masterpiece of H.L.A. Hart's enormous contribution to the study of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. Its elegant language and balanced argumentshave sparked wide debate and unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of scholarship in this area--much of it devoted to attacking or defending Hart's theories. Principal among Hart's critics is renowned lawyer and political philosopher Ronald Dworkin who in the 1970s and 80s mounted aseries of challenges to Hart's Concept of Law . It seemed that Hart let these challenges go unanswered until, after his death in 1992, his answer to Dworkin's criticism was discovered among his papers.In this valuable and long-awaited new edition Hart presents an Epilogue in which he answers Dworkin and some of his other most influential critics including Fuller and Finnis. Written with the same clarity and candor for which the first edition is famous, the Epilogue offers a sharperinterpretation of Hart's own views, rebuffs the arguments of critics like Dworkin, and powerfully asserts that they have based their criticisms on a faulty understanding of Hart's work. Hart demonstrates that Dworkin's views are in fact strikingly similar to his own. In a final analysis, Hart'sresponse leaves Dworkin's criticisms considerably weakened and his positions largely in question.Containing Hart's final and powerful response to Dworkin in addition to the revised text of the original Concept of Law , this thought-provoking and persuasively argued volume is essential reading for lawyers and philosophers throughout the world.","['Law', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Academic', 'School', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'History', '20th Century']"

The Fox in the Attic,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311421.The_Fox_in_the_Attic,"A tale of enormous suspense and growing horror, The Fox in the Attic is the widely acclaimed first part of Richard Hughes's monumental historical fiction, ""The Human Predicament."" Set in the early 1920s, the book centers on Augustine, a young man from an aristocratic Welsh family who has come of age in the aftermath of World War I. Unjustly suspected of having had a hand in the murder of a young girl, Augustine takes refuge in the remote castle of Bavarian relatives. There his hopeless love for his devout cousin Mitzi blinds him to the hate that will lead to the rise of German fascism. The book reaches a climax with a brilliant description of the Munich putsch and a disturbingly intimate portrait of Adolph Hitler.The Fox in the Attic , like its no less remarkable sequel The Wooden Shepherdess , offers a richly detailed, Tolstoyan overview of the modern world in upheaval. At once a novel of ideas and an exploration of the dark spaces of the heart, it is a book in which the past returns in all its original uncertainty and strangeness.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Germany', 'War', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century']"

Make Room! is set in the year 1999 and the world has become a grim and terribly overpopulated place, bleak and foreboding. This sets the premise for Harrison's novel, and fans of his earlier more comic works may be surprised at the seriousness of this novel.

While the novel contains elements of classic detective fiction--the hard-boiled protagonist, the seductive mistress, the portraits of corruption and perfidy--Harrison's true concern is less the story itself and more the opportunity the story offers to give the reader a glance at a dismal and broken world. The state of overpopulation has altered life in innumerable ways, and Harrison is keenly interested in documenting the catastrophic effects of this burden on all human relationships.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Classics', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Mystery', 'Novels', 'Fantasy']"

The Economy of Cities,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85398.The_Economy_of_Cities,"The thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to locally produce goods that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.In the foremost chapter of the book, Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition.*from Wikpedia","['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Urbanism', 'Urban Planning', 'Cities', 'Urban Studies', 'Urban', 'History', 'Architecture', 'Politics']"

The Peter Principle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890728.The_Peter_Principle,"This book caused a storm when first published in 1969, battering up the bestseller list to #1, charming readers from Topeka to Timbuktu, and finally, brilliantly, blessedly giving the world an answer to a question that nags us Why is incompetence so maddeningly rampant and so vexingly triumphant? The book and the phrase it defined are now considered comedic-yet-classic cornerstones of organizational thought, and in honor of the book's fortieth anniversary, Robert I. Sutton has written a foreword introducing the book to a new generation of readers. The Peter Principle, the eponymous law Laurence Peter coined, explains that ""in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."" Everyone from the office intern to the CEO, from the low-level civil servant to a nation's president will inevitably rise to his or her level of incompetence, if it hasn't happened already. Dr. Peter's glorious revelation explains why incompetence is at the root of everything we endeavor to do why schools bestow ignorance, why governments condone anarchy, why courts dispense injustice, why prosperity causes unhappiness, and why utopian plans never generate utopias. With the wit of James Thurber or Mark Twain, the psychological and anthropological acuity of Sigmund Freud or Margaret Mead, and the theoretical impact of Isaac Newton or Copernicus, Dr. Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull's brilliant book explains how incompetence and its accompanying symptoms, syndromes, and remedies define the world and the work we do in it.","['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Management', 'Humor', 'Leadership', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Economics']"

On Cats,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5218349-on-cats,"Doris Lessing's love affair with cats began at a young age, when she became intrigued with the semiferal creatures on the African farm where she grew up. Her fascination with the handsome, domesticated creatures that have shared her flats and her life in London remained undiminished, and grew into real love with the awkwardly lovable El Magnifico, the last cat to share her home.On Cats is a celebrated classic, a memoir in which we meet the cats that have slunk and bullied and charmed their way into Doris Lessing's life. She tells their stories—their exploits, rivalries, terrors, affections, ancient gestures, and learned behaviors—with vivid simplicity. And she tells the story of herself in relation to cats: the way animals affect her and she them, and the communication that grows possible between them—a language of gesture and mood and desire as eloquent as the spoken word. No other writer conveys so truthfully the real interdependence of humans and cats or convinces us with such stunning recognition of the reasons why cats matter.Bringing together the celebrated stories, and , and the memoir , this book brilliantly evokes the subtleties of feline existence and convinces us of the reasons why cats really matter.","['Nonfiction', 'Cats', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Short Stories', 'Essays', 'Nobel Prize', 'Africa', 'Biography Memoir']"

The Art of Literary Research,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/427689.The_Art_of_Literary_Research,"Since The Art of Literary Research was first published in 1963, it has been the established guide to the purposes, methods, and pleasures of research in English and American literature. It is the essential companion for courses in bibliography and research techniques and for programs in independent study, advanced composition, and undergraduate honors. For interested readers who have other vocational plans, its authors-experienced researchers themselves-provide an intimate view of the way professional scholars go about their specialized and challenging tasks. This extensively revised Fourth Edition takes full account of recent developments that have virtually revolutionized certain important areas of the discipline. The computer, as newly written pages demonstrate, not only has eliminated much of the drudgery formerly associated with the gathering, storage, and retrieval of raw data but has made possible many analytical and lexical operations that had been beyond human capacity, yet without diminishing the amount of sheer brain work still required to produce a genuine contribution to knowledge. The book also suggests that ""traditional"" literary studies, freshly evaluated, are compatible with the current emphasis on critical theory, not inimical to it. The ongoing revision of the literary canon under the impact of women's studies, African-American studies, and other movements, as well as the intensified scholarly and critical interest in present-day writers, is reflected in the book's hundreds of illustrative examples, extensive lists of several related books and articles, and hands-on exercises. The exercises range from the simple, short answer type that offer practice in the use of secondary materials such as can be found in any college library, to projects that may occupy a number of weeks of research in primary sources and are geared to the extensive holdings of large university libraries. The basic rationale and structure of the book, having proved themselves in previous editions, remain unchanged. The first half outlines the principles underlying the critical examination of evidence and describes in detail the chief branches of literary inquiry. Further chapters offer practical advice on bibliographical procedure and note-taking, particularly as these are made more efficient by electronic aids, and on the writing of scholarly papers (in one of the best discussions of the craft of expository prose t be found in any textbook); guide the student through the great American and British libraries whose stocks of books and manuscripts are indispensable to original literary research; and reviews the rewards, obligations, and ethics of the profession.","['Nonfiction', 'Grad School', 'Literary Criticism']"

The author of this book is a lover, a visionary of the natural world, an elegist, a phenomenologist of encounter, a mystic of the night, a spirit of defiant freedom who in the Second World War had been a leader in the French Resistance. The book includes work in the different forms Char fluently moves among—the verse poem, the prose poem, and the aphoristic sequence—and displays his characteristic stylistic gifts: vivid concreteness, speculative incisiveness, archipelago-like scope. The word is an island belonging to a unity always partially hidden. Robert Baker’s resonant translation brings into English this language of intuitive crossings. A poet of pessimism and hope at once, perhaps the greatest French practitioner of the prose poem since Rimbaud, Char writes a beautifully open poetry of his avventura amorosa with life itself.",['Poetry']

In Stigma the interplay of alternatives the stigmatized individual must face every day is brilliantly examined by one of America’s leading social analysts.","['Sociology', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Social Science', 'Mental Health', 'Academic', 'Theory', 'Disability Studies']"

Plumb, New York Times Book Review Starting in a hollowed log of wood―some thousand miles up a river, with an infinitesimal prospect of returning! I ask myself ""Why?"" and the only echo is ""damned fool! . . . the Devil drives!""So Richard Francis Burton, preparing for an exploration of the lower Congo in 1863, wrote to Monckton Milnes from the African kingdom of Dahomey. His answer, ""the Devil drives,"" applies not only to his geographical discoveries but also to the whole of his turbulent life.Burton was a true man of the Renaissance. He was soldier, explorer, ethnologist, archaeologist, poet, translator, and one of the two or three great linguists of his time. He was also an amateur physician, a botanist, a geologist, a swordsman, and a superb raconteur. He penetrated the sacred Muslim cities of Mecca and Medina at great risk and explored the forbidden city of Harar in Somaliland. He searched for the sources of the White Nile and discovered Lake Tanganyika.Burton's passion was not only for geographical discovery but also for the hidden in man. His enormous erudition on the sexual customs of the East and Africa, long confined by the pruderies of his time, finally found expression in the notes and commentary to his celebrated translation of the unexpurgated Arabian Nights .For this major biography of one of the most baffling heroes of any era, Fawn M.

The Open Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272847.The_Open_Work,"More than twenty years after its original appearance in Italian, The Open Work remains significant for its powerful concept of ""openness""--the artist's decision to leave arrangements of some constituents of a work to the public or to chance--and for its striking anticipation of two major themes of contemporary literary theory: the element of multiplicity and plurality in art, and the insistence on literary response as an interactive process between reader and text. The questions Umberto Eco raises, and the answers he suggests, are intertwined in the continuing debate on literature, art, and culture in general.This entirely new edition, edited for the English-language audience with the approval of Eco himself, includes an authoritative introduction by David Robey that explores Eco's thought at the period of , prior to his absorption in semiotics. The book now contains key essays on Eco's mentor Luigi Pareyson, on television and mass culture, and on the politics of art. Harvard University Press will publish separately and simultaneously the extended study of James Joyce that was originally part of , entitled . explores a set of issues in aesthetics that remain central to critical theory, and does so in a characteristically vivid style. Eco's convincing manner of presenting ideas and his instinct for the lively example are threaded compellingly throughout.

It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal battles, whose outcome would shape international politics for decades to come.Cornelius Ryan's compelling account of this final battle is a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate imperatives of survival, where, as the author describes it, “to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win.”It is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat. It is history at its best, a masterful illumination of the effects of war on the lives of individuals, and one of the enduring works on World War II.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Germany', 'Audiobook', 'European History', 'Historical']"

Thus the reach of the literary critic now extends to the social and ethical.A Grammar of Motives is a ""methodical meditation"" on such complex linguistic forms as plays, stories, poems, theologies, metaphysical systems, political philosophies, constitutions. A Rhetoric of Motives expands the field to human ways of persuasion and identification. Persuasion, as Burke sees it, ""ranges from the bluntest quest of advantage, as in sales promotion or propaganda, through courtship, social etiquette, education, and the sermon, to a 'pure' form that delights in the process of appeal for itself alone, without ulterior purpose. And identification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, 'I was a farm boy myself,' through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic's devout identification with the sources of all being.""","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Language', 'Theory', 'Academic', 'Communication', 'Writing', 'Literary Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Psychology']"
Philoktet,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2643656-philoktet,"Philoktet, geschrieben 1958/1964 und uraufgeführt 1968 am Münchner Residenztheater, ist eines der bekanntesten und wichtigsten Stücke des Autors. Diese Ausgabe gestattet den Vergleich mit der ›Vorlage‹, auf die Heiner Müller (1929-1995) antwortete: Sophokles' Philoktet, uraufgeführt 409 vor Christus in Athen.»Die griechische wie die deutsche Version des tragischen Lebens von Philoktet zeigen deutlich, daß die Sprache der Partner des Todes ist. Man hört ihn als ein dunkles musikalisches Branden im Epos, aus dem das Ensemble der großen griechischen Tragödien hervorgeht. Man hört ihn auch, nicht nur in seinem Philoktet, im Ensemble der Stücke von Müller. Wenn es sich nicht um eine Komödie handelt, ist das Theater ein Akt des Tötens - wie der Stierkampf. Das Instrument, das Werkzeug dieser Tötung ist das Wort. Diese Macht zeigt sich nirgends so radikal, so klinisch wie in diesen beiden Werken.« ...",[]
