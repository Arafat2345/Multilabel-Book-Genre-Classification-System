For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building.

The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'France', 'Literature', 'French Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical Fiction']"

The children made excellent, if occasionally unwilling, guinea pigs.Only a motion-study expert could have coped with their temperamental Pierce Arrow (nicknamed ""Foolish Carriage"").

They inevitably caused a sensation when they passed through a small town, and were once taken for an entire orphanage on an outing. Stops were, of course, frequent and once when one of the twelve got left behind, the loss was not discovered for several hours.Democracy was religiously practiced in the Gilbreth family through the medium of the family council. There was the matter of the dog, for instance. Dad firmly believed that ""any pet which didn't lay eggs was an extravagance that a man with twelve children could ill afford."" But the vote was twelve to one, with Mother abstaining, and the dog was added to the general bedlam.The Gilbreths astounded the Nantucket natives (who considered the Gilbreth homestead - a pair of lighthouses with a cottage squeezed between - a must stopping place for visiting tourists), paralyzed the Montclair schools, and routed the visiting psychiatrists.

Existentialism is a Humanism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism,"It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Jean-Paul Sartre, the most dominent European intellectual of the post-World War II decades, accepted an invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’s , along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal. This edition is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre’s introduction and a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Essays', 'Theory', 'French Literature']"

Bluff Farmer Giles lives in a land-of-fable England, full of giants and dragons. A reluctant hero like the Brave Little Tailor or Bilbo in The Hobbit, Giles wins a great reputation by firing his blunderbuss at a wandering giant--who retreats not in fear but to avoid this tiresome stinging ""insect"". One thing leads to another, and despite all his excuses the now famous Giles is called to save his country from the marauding dragon Chrysophylax. He has a legendary anti-dragon sword and a lot of luck, but dragons can be as devious as politicians... Tolkien crammed much sly wit into his little story, plus jokey philological explanations that Giles's amazing adventures are commemorated in Thames Valley placenames like Worminghall and Thame. It's illustrated with nearly 50 line drawings by Paula Baynes: Tolkien loved these, but some look sadly faded here, like fourth-generation photocopies. As a bonus, the anniversary edition includes an introduction telling the story's history, a transcription of the original, unfinished draft, and 23 pages of notes on allusions and names (Chrysophylax means ""keeper of gold"", which is indeed what dragons do).

Originally published in England in the spring of 1944—when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program—The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike.

A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.After thirty-two printings in the United States, has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority.

A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.On the first American edition of :""One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen.""—Henry Hazlitt, September 1944""In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often—at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough—that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.""—George Orwell,","['Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Sociology', 'Finance']"

The Good Woman of Setzuan, written during Brecht's exile and set in Communist China, is a parable of a young woman torn between obligation and reality, between love and practicality, and between her own needs and those of her friends and neighbors.Adhering closely to the original German text, this is a performance-friendly translation of one of Brecht's most popular plays.","['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Theatre', 'Read For School', 'Literature', 'Germany']"

Mitford's wickedly funny prose follows these characters through misguided marriages and dramatic love affairs, as the shadow of World War II begins to close in on their rapidly vanishing world.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Humor', 'British Literature', '20th Century', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Modern Classics']"

The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the ""simple, peaceful people"" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that ""there are no peaceful people"" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and ""a free man,"" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into ""a slow, silent, waiting revenge."" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal – ""to break man’s spirit permanently"" – is impossible.The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that ""the flies have conquered the flypaper."" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Literary Fiction']"

If the rise of democracy set some people free, at the same time it gave birth to a society in which the individual feels alienated and dehumanized. Using the insights of psychoanalysis as probing agents, Fromm's work analyzes the illness of contemporary civilization as witnessed by its willingness to submit to totalitarian rule.","['Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Classics', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Society', 'German Literature']"

Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85812.Dialectic_of_Enlightenment,"Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. ""What we had set out to do,"" the authors write in the Preface, ""was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism.""Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present.The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization.Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. ""Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology."" This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book.This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature']"

It is a story of a ruthless dictator and his schemes to dispose of a political adversary in an unnamed Latin American country usually identified as Guatemala.

Drawing from his experiences as a journalist writing under repressive conditions, Asturias employs such literary devices as satire to convey the government’s transgressions and surrealistic dream sequences to demonstrate the police state’s impact on the individual psyche. Asturias’s stance against all forms of injustice in Guatemala caused critics to view the author as a compassionate spokesperson for the oppressed. My work,” Asturias promised when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, “will continue to reflect the voice of the people, gathering their myths and popular beliefs and at the same time seeking to give birth to a universal consciousness of Latin American problems.”","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Nobel Prize', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century']"

He offered Barbara Wright his “heartiest congratulations,” “I have always thought that nothing is untranslatable.Here is new proof.” To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the 1947 French publication of Exercises de Style , New Directions has asked several writers to contribute new exercises as a tribute. Tantalizing examples include Jonathan Lethem’s “Cyberpunk,” Harry Mathew’s “Phonetic Eros,” and Frederic Tuten’s “Beatnik” exercises.

The Setting Sun,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194740.The_Setting_Sun,"The post-war period in Japan was one of immense social change as Japanese society adjusted to the shock of defeat and to the occupation of Japan by American forces and their allies. Osamu Dazai’s The Setting Sun takes this milieu as its background to tell the story of the decline of a minor aristocratic family.The story is told through the eyes of Kazuko, the unmarried daughter of a widowed aristocrat. Her search for self meaning in a society devoid of use for her forms the crux of Dazai’s novel. It is a sad story, and structurally is a novel very much within the confines of the Japanese take on the novel in a way reminiscent of authors such as Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata – the social interactions are peripheral and understated, nuances must be drawn, and for readers more used to Western novelistic forms this comes across as being rather wishy-washy.Kazuko’s mother falls ill, and due to their financial circumstances they are forced to take a cottage in the countryside. Her brother, who became addicted to opium during the war is missing. When he returns, Kazuko attempts to form a liaison with the novelist Uehara. This romantic displacement only furthers to deepen her alienation from society.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Japanese Literature', 'Japan', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Asian Literature', 'Asia', '20th Century']"

Fitting herself in its harness, the old woman manages, with the last of her strength, to drag it onward to the next battle. In the enduring figure of Mother Courage, Bertolt Brecht has created one of the most extraordinary characters in the literature of drama.","['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'School', 'Germany', 'Literature', '20th Century']"

At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering from extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes an improper joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen. As their personal struggle plays itself out on an international stage, creates a Dickensian canvas of heroism and venality, violence and tragedy, charged with narrative enchantment on every page.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Travel', 'European Literature']"

Only Yesterday,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197170.Only_Yesterday,"Israeli Nobel Laureate S.Y. Agnon's famous masterpiece, his novel Only Yesterday, here appears in English translation for the first time. Published in 1945, the book tells a seemingly simple tale about a man who immigrates to Palestine with the Second Aliya--the several hundred idealists who returned between 1904 and 1914 to work the Hebrew soil as in Biblical times and revive Hebrew culture. Only Yesterday quickly became recognized as a monumental work of world literature, but not only for its vivid historical reconstruction of Israel's founding society. This epic novel also engages the reader in a fascinating network of meanings, contradictions, and paradoxes all leading to the question, what, if anything, controls human existence?Seduced by Zionist slogans, young Isaac Kumer imagines the Land of Israel filled with the financial, social, and erotic opportunities that were denied him, the son of an impoverished shopkeeper, in Poland. Once there, he cannot find the agricultural work he anticipated. Instead Isaac happens upon house-painting jobs as he moves from secular, Zionist Jaffa, where the ideological fervor and sexual freedom are alien to him, to ultra-orthodox, anti-Zionist Jerusalem. While some of his Zionist friends turn capitalist, becoming successful merchants, his own life remains adrift and impoverished in a land torn between idealism and practicality, a place that is at once homeland and diaspora. Eventually he marries a religious woman in Jerusalem, after his worldly girlfriend in Jaffa rejects him.Led astray by circumstances, Isaac always ends up in the place opposite of where he wants to be, but why? The text soars to Surrealist-Kafkaesque dimensions when, in a playful mode, Isaac drips paint on a stray dog, writing ""Crazy Dog"" on his back. Causing panic wherever he roams, the dog takes over the story, until, after enduring persecution for so long without ""understanding"" why, he really does go mad and bites Isaac. The dog has been interpreted as everything from the embodiment of Exile to a daemonic force, and becomes an unforgettable character in a book about the death of God, the deception of discourse, the power of suppressed eroticism, and the destiny of a people depicted in all its darkness and promise.","['Fiction', 'Israel', 'Nobel Prize', 'Jewish', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Judaica']"

Осъдени души,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20786661,"""Осъдени души"" е колкото личен роман на една англичанка и един испански монах, толкова и роман на широки обществени отношения. Личният роман е вплетен в голямата борба на испанския народ срещу силите на реакцията - за свободата и за републиката.Без да си поставя за задача цялостното изображение на тая борба, Димов я засяга както в нейните широки исторически, социално-икономически и идейни причини, така и в редица нейни конкретни прояви, особено във втората част на романа, когато избухва бунтът на монархистите. За автора има две Испании - традиционната Испания на аристократите, католическото духовенство, реакцията и нова Испания - на републиката, работниците, борците за свобода и социални реформи. Димов се старае да нарисува тия две Испании - чрез поражението на отделни лица, чрез очертаване на големите линии на Испанската гражданска война, чрез конкретни прояви на кървавата борба между стара, умираща и нова, възраждаща се Испания и най-сетне чрез многобройни анализи на испанския характер и испанския живот в миналото и настоящето.Интересен е похватът на Димов - първата част на романа ""Краят на едно приключение"" ни поставя във Франкова Испания на реакцията, за да ни въведе по-късно във втората и третата част в борческа Испания на републиката и гражданската война. Естествено тая съпоставка - по пътя на контраста - води до по-релефни очертания. Същият похват е използван и при изображението на главната героиня: в първата част на романа тя е дадена в крайната, последната фаза на своето развитие, за да бъде показана и проследена във втората и третата част историята на това развитие.","['Bulgarian Literature', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Bulgaria', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'School', 'Drama', 'Romance']"

The five members of the crew were welded by the crash into a single whole, one tiny forged weapon in the vast territory of the enemy--weak and ineffectual--yet confident as only men can be whose minds are free. Francoise's family accepted them calmly. In Francoise it was faith, a simple piety so humble, so complete that all the mechanized myrmidons of the Reich could not touch her spirit. In her father it was stubbornness, that glorious pigheadedness of the French peasant who won't be pushed around. In her grandmother it was a kinship with the infinite. Having survived two wars, she remained unmoved by the swaggering vainglory of the Nazi. And in Pierre it was hatred, a hatred so deep that only rarely did it flash on the surface. It was natural that Francoise should be so strongly drawn to Franklin, the pilot. His gentle strength, his sensitive mind, the careful restrained warmth of his emotion found a calm, sure response in the simple innocence and candor of the girl. All through the delirious pain of his torn, wounded arm, Franklin felt the girl's presence like a cool, comforting hand. In the end it was her courage and, above all, her faith which saved him--saved him--not only from the enemy but from himself.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'War', 'France', 'Romance', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'British Literature', '20th Century']"

The Collected Dorothy Parker,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44458.The_Collected_Dorothy_Parker,"Dorothy Parker, more than any of her contemporaries, captured the spirit of the Jazz Age in her poetry and prose, and The Collected Dorothy Parker includes an introduction by Brendan Gill in Penguin Modern Classics.Dorothy Parker was the most talked-about woman of her day, notorious as the hard-drinking bad girl with a talent for stinging repartee and endlessly quotable one-liners. The decadent 1920s and 1930s in New York were a time of great experiment and daring for women. For the rich, life seemed a continual party, but the excesses took their emotional toll. In the bitingly witty poems and stories collected here, along with her articles and reviews, she brilliantly captures the spirit of the decadent Jazz Age in New York, exposing both the dazzle and the darkness. But beneath the sharp perceptions and acidic humour, much of her work poignantly expresses the deep vulnerability of a troubled, self-destructive woman who, in the words of philosopher Irwin Edman, was 'a Sappho who could combine a heartbreak with a wisecrack'.Dorothy Parker (1893-1967) was born in West End, New Jersey, and grew up in New York. In 1916 she sold some of her poetry to the editor of , and was subsequently given an editorial position on the magazine. She then became drama critic of and the central figure of the celebrated Algonquin Round Table, whose members included George S. Kaufman and Harpo Marx.

A literary tour de force, here is a novel unlike any other, one in which drug addiction, poverty, and human failure somehow suggest a defense of human dignity and a reason for hope.Special contributions by Russell Banks, Bettina Drew, James R. Giles, Carlo Rotella, William Savage, Lee Stringer, Studs Terkel, Kurt Vonnegut, and others.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'American', 'Noir']"

Conversations in Sicily,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1165806.Conversations_in_Sicily,"Conversations in Sicily holds a special place in the annals of literature.It stands as a modern classic not only for its powerful thematic resonance as one of the great novels of Italian anti-fascism but also as a trailblazer for its style, which blends literary modernism with the pre-modern fable in a prose of lyric beauty. Comparing Vittorini's work to Picasso's, Italo Calvino described Conversations as ""the book-Guernica.""The novel begins at a time in the narrator's life when nothing seems to matter; whether he is reading newspaper posters blaring of wartime massacres, lying in bed with his wife or girlfriend, or flipping through the pages of a dictionary it is all the same to him―until he embarks on a journey back to Sicily, the home he has not seen in some fifteen years. In traveling through the Sicilian countryside and in variously hilarious and tragic conversations with its people―his indomitable mother in particular―he reconnects with his roots and rediscovers some basic human values.In the introduction Hemingway wrote for the American debut of Conversations (published as In Sicily by New Directions in 1949) he remarked: ""I care very much about Vittorini's ability to bring rain with him when he comes, if the earth is dry and that is what you need."" More recently, American critic Donald Heiney wrote that in this one book, Vittorini ""like Rabelais and Cervantes...adds a new artistic dimension to the history of literature.""","['Fiction', 'Italy', 'Italian Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Travel', 'Literary Fiction']"

Desani chronicling the adventures of an Anglo-Malay man in search of wisdom and enlightenment. ""As far back as in 1951,"" Desani later wrote, ""I said H. Hatterr was a portrait of a man, the common vulgar species, found everywhere, both in the East and in the West"". Salman Rushdie comments[1]: “ The writer I have placed alongside Narayan, G.V. Desani, has fallen so far from favour that the extraordinary All About H. Hatterr is presently out of print everywhere, even in India. Milan Kundera once said that all modern literature descends from either Richardson's Clarissa or Sterne's Tristram Shandy, and if Narayan is India's Richardson then Desani is his Shandean other. Hatterr's dazzling, puzzling, leaping prose is the first genuine effort to go beyond the Englishness of the English language. His central figure, 'fifty-fifty of the species,' the half-breed as unabashed anti-hero, leaps and capers behind many of the texts in this book. Hard to imagine I. Allan Sealy's Trotter-Nama without Desani.

Collingwood. It was originally published posthumously in 1946, having been mainly reconstructed from Collingwood's manuscripts, many of which are now lost. This important work examines how the idea of history has evolved from the time of Herodotus to the twentieth century, and offers Collingwood's own view of what history is. For this revised edition, Collingwood's most important lectures on the philosophy of history are published here for the first time. These texts have been prepared by Jan van der Dussen from manuscripts that have only recently become available. The lectures contain Collingwood's first comprehensive statement of his philosophy of history; they are therefore essential for a full understanding of his thought, and in particular for a correct interpretation of The Idea of History itself. Van der Dussen contributes a substantial introduction in which heexplains the background to this new edition and surveys the scholarship of the last fifty years.","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Academic', 'Theory', 'World History', 'Essays', 'Anthropology', 'Historical', 'Read For School']"

But the devastation the collapse has wrought on ordinary citizens has only strengthened Lanny’s socialist ideals—much to the chagrin of his heiress wife, Irma, a confirmed capitalist. In Germany to visit relatives, Lanny encounters a disturbing atmosphere of hatred and jingoism. His concern over the growing popularity of the Nazi Party escalates when he meets Adolf Hitler, the group’s fanatical leader, and the members of his inner circle. But Lanny’s gravest fear is the threat a national socialist government poses to the German Jewish family of Hansi, the musician husband of Lanny’s sister, Bess—a threat that will impel the international art dealer to risk his wealth, his future, even his life in a courageous attempt to rescue his loved ones from a terrible fate. Winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dragon’s Teeth brilliantly captures the nightmarish march toward the Second World War.

Within this story of passion and betrayal, Moravia calmly strips away the pride and arrogance hiding the corrupt heart of Italian Fascism.","['Fiction', 'Italy', 'Italian Literature', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction']"
Arcanum 17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168311.Arcanum_17,"André Breton wrote Arcanum 17 during a trip to the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec in the months after D-Day in 1944, when the Allied troops were liberating Occupied Europe. Using the huge Percé Rock—its impermanence, its slow-motion crumbling, its singular beauty—as his central metaphor, Breton considers love and loss, aggression and war, pacifism, feminism and the occult, in a book that is part prose and part poetry, part reality and part dream. In the 17th card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck, a naked woman beneath a sky of stars pours water from two urns into water and onto land. This card represents hope, renewal and resurrection—the themes that permeate Arcanum 17 . Considered radical at the time, Breton’s ideas today seem almost prescient, yet still breathtaking in their passionate underlying belief in the indestructibility of life and the freedom of the human spirit.Translator Zack Rogow shared the 1993 PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize for Earthlight by André Breton.

La famiglia Karnowski,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17676033-la-famiglia-karnowski,"Bastano a volte poche pagine per accorgersi di avere fra le mani un grande romanzo, e per cogliere quel timbro puro che ne fa un classico. È ciò che accade con La famiglia Karnowski di Israel J. Singer, maestro dimenticato, rimasto per troppo tempo nel cono d'ombra del più celebre fratello minore Isaac B., Premio Nobel per la letteratura. La pubblicazione di questo libro, fra i memorabili del secolo scorso, ha quindi il sapore di un evento, e di un risarcimento: finalmente, il lettore potrà immergersi nel grandioso affresco familiare in cui si snoda, attraverso tre generazioni e tre paesi – Polonia, Germania e America –, la saga dei Karnowski. Che comincia con David, il capostipite, il quale all'alba del Novecento lascia lo shtetl polacco in cui è nato, ai suoi occhi emblema dell'oscurantismo, per dirigersi alla volta di Berlino, forte del suo tedesco impeccabile e ispirato dal principio secondo il quale bisogna «essere ebrei in casa e uomini in strada». Il figlio Georg, divenuto un apprezzato medico e sposato a una gentile, incarnerà il vertice del percorso di integrazione e ascesa sociale dei Karnowski – percorso che imboccherà però la fatale parabola discendente con il nipote: lacerato dal disprezzo di sé, Jegor, capovolgendo il razzismo nazista in cui è cresciuto, porterà alle estreme conseguenze, in una New York straniante e nemica, la contraddizione che innerva l'intera storia familiare. Con una sapiente orchestrazione che è insieme un e un inabissarsi, Singer non solo ci regala pagine d'inconsueta bellezza ma getta anche uno sguardo chiaroveggente sulla situazione degli ebrei nel­l'Europa dei suoi anni, rivelando quelle virtù profetiche che, quasi loro malgrado, solo i veri scrittori possiedono.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Jewish', 'Poland', 'Historical', 'The United States Of America', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Audiobook']"

En effet, l'asphyxie gagne du terrain, et l'on assiste avec effroi au rétrécissement inexorable des appartements.

27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Other Plays,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394425.27_Wagons_Full_of_Cotton_and_Other_Plays,"The thirteen one-act plays collected in this volume include some of Tennessee Williams's finest and most powerful work. They are full of the perception of life as it is, and the passion for life as it ought to be, which have made The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire classics of the American theater.Only one of these plays ( The Purification ) is written in verse, but in all of them the approach to character is by way of poetic revelation. Whether Williams is writing of derelict roomers in a New Orleans boarding house ( The Lady of Larkspur Lotion ) or the memories of a venerable traveling salesman ( The Last of My Solid Gold Watches ) or of delinquent children ( This Property is Condemned ), his insight into human nature is that of the poet. He can compress the basic meaning of life―its pathos or its tragedy, its bravery or the quality of its love―into one small scene or a few moments of dialogue.Mr. Williams's views on the role of the little theater in American culture are contained in a stimulating essay, ""Something wild...,"" which serves as an introduction to this collection.","['Plays', 'Drama', 'Theatre', 'Southern', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'College']"

Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. ""Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'China', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'War', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'World War II', 'Novels']"

The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9757482-the-age-of-anxiety,"The first critical edition of a poem that named an eraWhen it was first published in 1947, The Age of Anxiety ―W. H. Auden's last, longest, and most ambitious book-length poem―immediately struck a powerful chord, capturing the imagination of the cultural moment that it diagnosed and named. Beginning as a conversation among four strangers in a barroom on New York's Third Avenue, Auden's analysis of Western culture during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize and inspired a symphony by Leonard Bernstein as well as a ballet by Jerome Robbins. Yet reviews of the poem were sharply divided, and today, despite its continuing fame, it is unjustly neglected by readers.This volume―the first annotated, critical edition of the poem―introduces this important work to a new generation of readers by putting it in historical and biographical context and elucidating its difficulties. Alan Jacobs's introduction and thorough annotations help today's readers understand and appreciate the full richness of a poem that contains some of Auden's most powerful and beautiful verse, and that still deserves a central place in the canon of twentieth-century poetry.","['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Psychology', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'World War II', 'Classic Literature', 'Plays']"

But if I have a favourite among my novels, it is Bright Day, which I wrote towards the end of the war.""The novel was written towards the end of World War II. JBP disclaimed any autobiographical roots in the work, but it is nontheless resonent with his early youth and coincided with JBP's recoil from the commercial film world. Bright Day was the only serious novel that he wrote in the first person.Gregory Dawson, the novel's hero, is a middle-aged film script writer who goes off to Cornwall to complete a script. At his hotel he spots Lord and Lady Harndean, and realizes that they are the Malcolm and Eleanor Nixey he knew when he worked as a clerk in a Bruddersford wool firm. They represent the beginning of the break-up of the bright day which had preceded the year 1914, and thus the story starts to unfold...Vincent Brome, one of JBP's biographers, wrote: ""Bright Day is one of Priestley's two most important and successful novels.

Selected Poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67998.Selected_Poems,"The first Nobel Prize in literature to be awarded to a Latin American writer went to the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a ""poetess"" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America. During her lifetime Mistral published four Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut, and Winepress. These are included in the ""Complete"" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the Poem of Chile , her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice. Le Guin has published five volumes of her own poetry, an English version of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching , and a volume of mutual translation with the Argentine poet Diana Bellessi, The Twins, the Dream/Las Gemalas, El Sueño. Strongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin has been working on this translation for five years.","['Poetry', 'Nobel Prize', 'Classics', 'Spanish Literature', 'Latin American', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'LGBT', '20th Century', 'Female Authors']"

This paradoxical work discovers being in the absence of being, mystery in the absence of mystery, both to be searched for limitlessly.

Journey to the Alcarria is the best known of his vagabundajes, Cela’s term for his books of travels, sketchbooks of regions or provinces. The Alcarria is a territory in New Castile, northeast of Madrid, surrounding most of the Guadalajara province. The region is high, rocky, and dry, and is famous for its honey.Cela himself is “the traveler,” an urban intellectual wandering from village to village, through farms and along country roads, in search of the Spanish character. Cela relishes his encounters with the simple, honest people of the Spanish countryside—the blushing maid in the tavern, the small-town shopkeeper with airs of grandeur lonely for companionship, the old peasant with his donkey who freely shares his bread and blanket with the stranger. These vignettes are narrated in a fresh, clear prose that is wonderfully evocative. As the New York Times wrote, Cela is “an outspoken observer of human life who built his reputation on portray­ing what he observed in a direct colloquial style.”","['Travel', 'Spain', 'Nonfiction', 'Nobel Prize', 'Spanish Literature', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Romance']"

C. P. Snow's Foreword gives sympathetic and witty insights into Hardy's life, with its rich store of anecdotes concerning his collaboration with the brilliant Indian mathematician Ramanujan, his aphorisms and idiosyncrasies, and his passion for cricket.

Miracle of the Rose,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/266034.Miracle_of_the_Rose,"This is the third of Genet's prose works to be published in the United States, following Our Lady of the Flowers (1963) and The Thief's Journal (1964). It is, however, Genet's second novel, having been written in La Santé and Tourelles prisons in 1943, directly after Our Lady of the Flowers. Like that first work, Miracle of the Rose was written in the solitude of a prison cell, on the pieces of white paper the penal authorities furnish the convicts for making paper bags.The work is set in the State prison of Fontevrault. It is the height of the German Occupation and in the prisons of France the convicts, barely subsisting on near-starvation rations, spend their endless days weaving camouflage nets for their German conquerors. is, first of all, an account of life at Fontevrault during that period. But Genet is no realist, and his account of prison life is an extraordinary mixture of dreams and reality, past and present.If Fontevrault is the present of his narrative, the past is the Mettray Reformatory, the almost idyllic, flower-covered ""prison colony"" for boys to which he was sent for theft as a mere child. It was here at Mettray that he was initiated into the life of confinement, into the world of the criminals and homosexuals in which he was to live for the next twenty-five years. Genet's story moves back and forth between Fontevrault and Mettray almost without the reader's being aware of the transition. Doubtless, in Genet's mind, there is no transition. Both prisons and both times fuse into one immense and erotic dream.The boys at Mettray do not pity or despise the hardened criminals at neighboring Fontevrault; on the contrary, they are the ""saints"" the boys look up to, the heroes they hope to emulate. More than fifteen years after his precocious arrival at the Mettray Reformatory, Genet finally reaches the Fontevrault Prison. Among the pimps and big shots, the crashers and chickens that form the homosexual hierarchy of the convict criminal society, he finds again many of his former boyhood friends and lovers.Foremost among them is Harcamone, a character notable in the narrative for his off-stage presence. Harcamone has been condemned to death for having killed the only guard at Fontevrault who had ever shown him the least bit of kindness. During the month and a half prior to his execution, his presence from his solitary cell on death row both encompasses and dominates the prison. At one point, as Harcamone passes Genet in the prison corridor, the author has a vision in which he sees the chains that bind Harcamone miraculously flower into a garland of white roses.contains many such visions wherein Genet, taking the dross of ""evil'' transmutes it into a work of beauty.","['Fiction', 'France', 'Queer', 'French Literature', 'LGBT', 'Gay', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Novels', '20th Century']"

She forces the reader to face the absurdity of the human condition, and then, having done so, proceeds to develop a dialectic of ambiguity which will enable him not to master the chaos, but to create with it.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Classics', 'France', 'Theory', 'Essays', 'Womens', 'French Literature', '20th Century']"
Medallions,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/561312.Medallions,"Medallions is a collection of eight documentary stories originally published in Poland in 1946 that recount Nazi war crimes under the German occupation of the country. The author, Zofia Nalkowska, was a member of a special committee for the investigation of Nazi crimes in Poland, and the stories reflect facts she learned from victims and witnesses to atrocities inflicted on Polish civilians.Considered a masterpiece of antifascist world literature, Medallions stands as the culmination of Nalkowska's literary style, a style the Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz once described as ""the iron capital of her art and one of the very few exportables in our national literature."" More than mere historical record, Medallions offers the reader startling immediacy, the repetition of an event as it persists in the testimonial present, in the scars on the consciousness and conscience of individuals.","['Polish Literature', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'School', 'War', 'Short Stories', 'Poland', 'Holocaust', 'World War II']"

Retired scientist Mr. Rock, ""an old man in love with his goose,"" lives in a cottage with his adult granddaughter Elizabeth. Bordering the grounds of the school, the cottage--which the State has given Rock for the duration of his life in gratitude for his scientific contributions--is coveted by the school's two spinsterish governesses, Misses Edge and Baker. As the story opens, two students are missing. The resultant search for their whereabouts raises numerous fears and have they been harmed? have they left on their own, alone? or have they perhaps been persuaded by the school's only male instructor, Sebastian Birt? how will the governesses keep the news from parents and State authorities until the girls have been found and an acceptable story contrived? will Rock report them for negligence? Meanwhile, as rumors and versions of the girls' disappearance spread through the school, and the governesses attempt to conceal their alarm by preparing for the school's tenth annual Founders Day Ball, the seemingly innocent proceedings take on an air of mystery, intrigue, and impending doom.","['Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Adult', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction']"
What Makes Sammy Run?,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101191.What_Makes_Sammy_Run_,"What Makes Sammy Run?Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times—from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Film', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'American', 'Media Tie In', 'Self Help', 'Contemporary']"

Праці ці були читані для вужчих і ширших авдиторій, але друкуються вони вперше. Деякі з них викликали пристрасну... читач думає: дискусію? — ""і, пристрасну лайку на адресу автора. Власне, виявило-ся при цьому дві реакції тих, хто відчув себе безпосередньо заторкненим. Одні намагалися всі неґативи звалити зі своєї партії на конкуренпійну - ніби тут ідеться про партії, а не про психологічний тип людини! Другі, щоб не допустити поширення висловлених тут „баламутних“ думок, вирішили зчинити якнайбільший галас, обвинувачуючи автора в усіх смертельних гріхах, від розкладу українського суспільства починаючи і запереченням ідеї самостійної України (!!!) кінчаючи.Автор не має сумніву, що і книжка в цілому викличе подібні реакції (і тим ще раз потвердить стару істину: Юпітере, ти сердишся, отже, ти не маєш рації); а надто аматори „уловлювати душі"" методою висмикування окремих фраз знайдуть собі рясну поживу. Не зважаючи на це, автор наважується випустити свої „думки проти течії“ в світ, бо значення порушених тут питань видається йому важливішим за свою і чужі амбіції.Автор не міг і не хотів давати готових розв’язань і викінчених формул, уважаючи це за передчасне. Не належачи до тих, хто взагалі виступає проти гасел, автор міркував, що ще не пора висувати якісь нові викінчені гасла, своїм основним завданням ставлячи — дати ґрунт для мислення, для дискусії. Надто часто в нас шукають книжки „до подушки“, щоб швидше заснути. В протилежність цьому автор хотів дати читачеві книжку, яка не давала б йому спати, яка хвилювала б і може навіть дратувала б його, яка змушувала б думати, ятрила б рани, спонукала активно шукати виходу з теперішньої ситуації, посувала б українську духовість, а тим самим і український державнобудівний рух уперед. Якщо книжка це завдання виконає, автор буде задоволений, які б налички на нього, не наліплювали ті, хто своїм основним завданням поставив виключити з українства здатність мислити.(Юрій Шерех, травень 1948)Зміст:Від автораДонцов ховає Донцова.

For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17071587-for-the-time-being,"The first critical edition of Auden's only explicitly religious long poemFor the Time Being is a pivotal book in the career of one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. W. H. Auden had recently moved to America, fallen in love with a young man to whom he considered himself married, rethought his entire poetic and intellectual equipment, and reclaimed the Christian faith of his childhood. Then, in short order, his relationship fell apart and his mother, to whom he was very close, died. In the midst of this period of personal crisis and intellectual remaking, he decided to write a poem about Christmas and to have it set to music by his friend Benjamin Britten. Applying for a Guggenheim grant, Auden explained that he understood the difficulty of writing something vivid and distinctive about that most clichéd of subjects, but welcomed the challenge. In the end, the poem proved too long and complex to be set by Britten, but in it we have a remarkably ambitious and poetically rich attempt to see Christmas in double focus: as a moment in the history of the Roman Empire and of Judaism, and as an ever-new and always contemporary event for the believer. For the Time Being is Auden's only explicitly religious long poem, a technical tour de force, and a revelatory window into the poet's personal and intellectual development. This edition provides the most accurate text of the poem, a detailed introduction by Alan Jacobs that explains its themes and sets the poem in its proper contexts, and thorough annotations of its references and allusions.","['Poetry', 'Christmas', 'Religion', '20th Century', 'Holiday', 'Christianity', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Fiction']"

But inconceivable or not, the wealthy backer of the play was neatly skewered during dress rehersal and, with her customary flair for murder that turns eccentric, Pam North appeared abruptly on the scene.

A sharply observed record of day-to-day life under Nazi rule in Paris and a bitter commentary on literary life in those years, it has also been called ""a remarkable essay on courage and cowardice"" (Caroline Moorehead, Wall Street Journal). Here, David Ball provides not only the first English-translation of this important historical document, but also the first ever annotated, corrected edition. Guéhenno was a well-known political and cultural critic, left-wing but not communist, and uncompromisingly anti-fascist. Unlike most French writers during the Occupation, he refused to pen a word for a publishing industry under Nazi control. He expressed his intellectual, moral, and emotional resistance in this diary: his shame at the Vichy government's collaboration with Nazi Germany, his contempt for its falsely patriotic reactionary ideology, his outrage at its anti-Semitism and its vilification of the Republic it had abolished, his horror at its increasingly savage repression and his disgust with his fellow intellectuals who kept on blithely writing about art and culture as if the Occupation did not exist - not to mention those who praised their new masters in prose and poetry. Also a teacher of French literature, he constantly observed the young people he taught, sometimes saddened by their conformism but always passionately trying to inspire them with the values of the French cultural tradition he loved. Guéhenno's diary often includes his own reflections on the great texts he is teaching, instilling them with special meaning in the context of the Occupation. Complete with meticulous notes and a biographical index, Ball's edition of Guéhenno's epic diary offers readers a deeper understanding not only of the diarist's cultural allusions, but also of the dramatic, historic events through which he lived.","['History', 'France', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', '20th Century', 'Memoir', 'Diary', 'Biography', 'Literature']"

As Klemperer writes: ""it isn't only Nazi actions that have to vanish, but also the Nazi cast of mind, the typical Nazi way of thinking, and its breeding ground: the language of Nazism.""

Burroughs and Jack Kerouac sat down in New York City to write a novel about the summer of 1944, when one of their friends killed another in a moment of brutal and tragic bloodshed. The two authors were then at the dawn of their careers, having yet to write anything of note. Alternating chapters and narrators, Burroughs and Kerouac pieced together a hard-boiled tale of bohemian New York during World War II, full of drugs and obsession, art and violence. The manuscript, called And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks after a line from a news story about a fire at a circus, was submitted to publishing houses but rejected and confined to a filing cabinet for decades. First published in 2008, is a remarkable piece of American literary history, a fascinating window into the lives of its authors, and an engaging novel, a fast-paced read that brings to life a shocking murder at the dawn of the Beat Generation.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Crime', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literature', 'The United States Of America', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'True Crime']"

A detailed analysis of positivism and idealism brings Gramsci's philosophy of praxis and conception of historical materialism into sharp relief.

Agostino,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301873.Agostino,"L’Agostino deixa de ser un nen l’estiu en què la seva mare s’enamora d’un home. Aquella deessa que ell sempre havia imaginat dedicada i intocable és també una dona. Decebut i ressentit per aquesta descoberta, el protagonista malda per alliberar-se de la figura materna i comença a freqüentar amistats dubtoses que el portaran a deixar enrere la innocència. La brutalitat d’aquests nous amics l’espanta però també hi ha alguna cosa d’ells que el fascina, una atracció deliciosa i cruel que l’atrapa i el repulsa alhora. Moravia explora amb precisió la dolorosa i incerta aventura de l’adolescent que es veu atrapat entre dues edats. Més enllà de la descripció d’una etapa difícil i plena de turments, en aquesta història hi podem llegir els símptomes d’una altra crisi que se situa en el centre de tota l’obra de l’autor: el desajustament entre la consciència i la realitat. Nascut a Roma el 1907, Alberto Moravia va escriure la seva primera novel·la, Els indiferents, quan tenia poc menys de vint anys en un sanatori del nord d’Itàlia on es refeia d’una tuberculosi que no li va deixar acabar els estudis. Durant la Segona Guerra Mundial, va ser perseguit pels feixistes per haver escrit una sàtira política. Després del final de la guerra, torna a Roma i gaudeix d’una gran popularitat. La seva obra està conformada per una trentena de títols entre els quals destaquen El conformista, El menyspreu i La camperola. Algunes de les seves novel·les han estat adaptades al cinema per directors com ara Vittorio De Sica o Jean-Luc Godard. Agostino també va ser duta al cinema el 1962.

Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80795.Mimesis,"A half-century after its translation into English, Erich Auerbach's ""Mimesis"" still stands as a monumental achievement in literary criticism. A brilliant display of erudition, wit, and wisdom, his exploration of how great European writers from Homer to Virginia Woolf depicted reality has taught generations how to read Western literature. This new expanded edition includes a substantial essay in introduction by Edward Said as well as an essay, never before translated into English, in which Auerbach responds to his critics.A German Jew, Auerbach was forced out of his professorship at the University of Marburg in 1935. He left for Turkey, where he taught at the state university in Istanbul. There he wrote ""Mimesis,"" publishing it in German after the end of the war. Displaced as he was, Auerbach produced a work of great erudition that contains no footnotes, basing his arguments instead on searching, illuminating readings of key passages from his primary texts. His aim was to show how from antiquity to the twentieth century literature progressed toward ever more naturalistic and democratic forms of representation. This essentially optimistic view of European history now appears as a defensive--and impassioned--response to the inhumanity he saw in the Third Reich. Ranging over works in Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and English, Auerbach used his remarkable skills in philology and comparative literature to refute any narrow form of nationalism or chauvinism, in his own day and ours.For many readers, both inside and outside the academy, ""Mimesis"" is among the finest works of literary criticism ever written.","['Nonfiction', 'Literary Criticism', 'Philosophy', 'Criticism', 'Literature', 'History', 'Theory', 'Essays', 'Writing', 'German Literature']"

The Crucible: A Play in Four Acts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible,"""I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,"" Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Historical', 'High School', 'Literature', 'Theatre']"

Si allontana dal campo, rimane solo, si perde. È così, per caso, che cominciano le avventure del protagonista di Tempo di uccidere, indubbiamente il capolavoro di Ennio Flaiano. Un susseguirsi di casi fortuiti e banali crea le condizioni per le avventure del protagonista, un antieroe solitario che del caso diventa prigioniero e schiavo, tanto da arrivare a credere che la propria storia non sia nient'altro che il compiersi di un destino prescritto. Perché alla fine, in qualche modo, da ogni circostanza sembra scaturirne un'altra: un incidente, l'incontro con Miriam, l'amore, lo spettro di un omicidio e quello della lebbra. Tutto appare concatenato, tutto concorre a trascinarlo in una cupa crisi esistenziale.","['Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Classics', 'War', 'Africa', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century', 'Literature']"
Great Comedies and Tragedies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245141.Great_Comedies_and_Tragedies,"The Comedies with Introductions by Judith Buchanan These Comedies are among the best loved of Shakespeare's plays. In each a problem emerges, is then intensified to a point of maximum confusion and potential upset, before the chaos is resolved, however improbably, into general goodwill and a spate of marriages. The triumph of these plays lies in the way they mingle humorous stage business and dexterous word play with a more serious study of identity, gender, dreaming, the meaning of love, even of the theatre itself. They reassure us that with all its faults, the world will always in the end be redeemable. The Tragedies with Introductions by Emma Smith 'Not for an age but for all time.' So Ben Jonson established what we now take for granted: Shakespeare's unique place among the world's great authors. Romeo and Juliet shows us the archetypal story of fated young love; Hamlet, the tortured psyche of the young prince of Denmark; Othello, a strikingly modern representation of racial difference; King Lear, a man stripped of all material and psychological comforts; and Macbeth, a dark investigation of the origins and effects of, evil. The plays throw a fascinating light on the concerns of Shakespeare's day, yet offer perennial insights into the nature of human emotion.","['Classics', 'Poetry', 'Plays', 'Fiction']"
The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153955.The_Human_Use_of_Human_Beings,"Only a few books stand as landmarks in social and scientific upheaval. Norbert Wiener's classic is one in that small company. Founder of the science of cybernetics—the study of the relationship between computers and the human nervous system—Wiener was widely misunderstood as one who advocated the automation of human life. As this book reveals, his vision was much more complex and interesting. He hoped that machines would release people from relentless and repetitive drudgery in order to achieve more creative pursuits. At the same time he realized the danger of dehumanizing and displacement. His book examines the implications of cybernetics for education, law, language, science, technology, as he anticipates the enormous impact—in effect, a third industrial revolution—that the computer has had on our lives.","['Philosophy', 'Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Technology', 'Sociology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Society']"

Anthology of Black Humor,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211235.Anthology_of_Black_Humor,"This is the first publication in English of the anthology that contains Breton's definitive statement on l'humour noir, one of the seminal concepts of Surrealism, and his provocative assessments of the writers he most admired. While some of the authors featured in The Anthology of Black Humor are already well known to American readers--Swift, Kafka, Rimbaud, Poe, Lewis Carroll, and Baudelaire among them (and even then, Breton's selections are often surprising)--many others are sure to come as a revelation.The entries range from the acerbic aphorisms of Swift, Lichtenberg, and Duchamp to the theatrical slapstick of Christian Dietrich Grabbe, from the wry missives of Rimbaud and Jacques Vache to the manic paranoia of Dali, from the ferocious iconoclasm of Alfred Jarry and Arthur Craven to the offhand hilarity of Apollinaire at his most spontaneous. For each of the forty-five authors included, Breton has provided an enlightening biographical and critical preface, situating both the writer and the work in the context of black humor--a partly macabre, partly ironic, and often absurd turn of spirit that Breton defined as ""a superior revolt of the mind.""""Anthologies can aim to be groundbreaking or thought-provoking; few can be said to have introduced a new phrase--or a new concept--into the language. No one had ever used the term ""black humour"" before this one came along, unless, perhaps, it was from a racial angle.""--(1896-1966), the founder and principal theorist of the Surrealist movement, is one of the major literary figures of the past century.

Complete Poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1427974.Complete_Poems,"When she died in poverty at 31, Edith Edith Södergran had been dismissed as a mad, megalomaniac aristocrat by most of her Finnish contemporaries. Today she is regarded as Finland's greatest modern poet. Her poems - written in Swedish - are intensely visionary, and have been compared with Rimbaud's, yet they also show deep afﬁnities with Russian poetry, with the work of Blok, Mayakovsky and Severyanin in particular.Born in 1892 of a Finno-Swedish family, Edith Edith Södergran grew up in Raivola, a village on the Russian border, but was educated at a German school in St. Petersburg. Her early influences were Goethe and Heine, and she wrote first in German. The driving force of Edith Södergran's mature Swedish poetry was her struggle against TB, which she contracted in 1908. For much of her short life she was a semi-invalid in sanatoria in Finland and Switzerland. Her last years were spent amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and in desperate poverty in Raivola, where she died in 1923.Edith Edith Södergran saw herself as an inspired free spirit of a new order, a disciple on her own terms of Nietzsche, then of the nature mystic Rudolf Steiner, and finally of Christ. But her voice is subtle and wholly original. It transcends the limits imposed by her illness to make lyrical statements about the violence and darkness of the modern world - imagistic poems that are alarming in the surreal beauty of their fragmentary diction. David McDuff's edition is the first complete translation into English of Edith Edith Södergran's Swedish poetry. His versions adhere as closely as possible to the spirit and the letter of the Swedish original. In his introductory essay David McDuff gives a comprehensive and illuminating account of Edith Edith Södergran's life and work.","['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Swedish Literature', 'Finnish Literature', '20th Century', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Sweden', 'Literature', 'School', 'Adult']"

But when the game goes beyond their control the maids are compelled to try to make their fantasy a reality.'The most extraordinary example of the whirligigs of being and appearance, of the imaginary and the real, is to be found in [Genet's] The Maids.

"Autobiography: My Childhood, In the World, My Universities",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88046.Autobiography,"Maxim Gorky, like Leo Tolstoy, was primarily an autobiographical author, and the material here is considered amongst the greatest of his writings. Not only do they give the astonishingly varied life of Gorky from childhood through youth, but they also provide us with an unforgettable picture of one of the most crucial generations in Russian life and history – the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The autobiography begins at the age of five and ends with Gorky secure in his position as one of the leading Russian writers. From the beginning, the story is organized as a quest for knowledge and understanding, of oneself and the world one lives in. This quest brings Gorky into contact with the harsh realities of life in late 19th century Russia - the life that was to constitute his “universities”. We follow him as he turns from one job to another in an effort to make a living for himself - rag picker, errand and stock boy, junior clerk, bird catcher, cabin boy on a Volga steamer, apprentice in an icon factory, baker, watchman and freight handler at railroad stations. We move with Gorky in his life of wandering from one part of Russia to the next, and, in the course of the journey, we meet some of the most extraordinary characters in literature. The people that crowd the pages of his life history are as interesting as they are varied. Peasants, artisans, scholars, writers, teachers, policemen, government officials - they passed in and out of Gorky’s strange, sad life, leaving each one of them a vivid imprint on his keen mind. Through them he learned to build for himself a philosophy of life, and with the memory of them he painted for us those stark, vital pictures which make the unforgettable character of his book. Each character is sharply individualized, mountingly alive, fascinating. There is Gorky’s grandmother with her strength, her idealism, her superstition, her sympathy. Herself a folk bard, she passed on to Gorky the impulse to hearten others and a rich store of folk song and folk story. There is Smoury, the chef of the Volga steamer, whom Gorky was later to call one of his outstanding teachers. There is also Olga, the woman with whom Gorky had his first love affair; eccentric, irresponsible, flirtatious, but charming and kind. In his portrait of these and many other fascinating characters in the book, Gorky has given us his greatest - and one of the greatest life stories in literature.","['Russia', 'Biography', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature', 'Autobiography']"

Peter the First,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245705.Peter_the_First,"Here, for the first time, in its final form and in a new translation, is the epic Russian novel which has sold in its native country over two million copies. Alexey Tolstoy (who was not related to the author of War and Peace) began to study the character of his hero, Peter the First, in 1917. When he died almost thirty years later, Tolstoy was still working on his masterpiece, this huge historical canvas which gives brilliant life and meaning to a crucial period in Russian history. Tolstoy reanimates the past by a succession of character creations which range from the serf, Ivan Brodkin, to Peter's sinister and opportunistic favorite, Alexander Menshikoff; from the old Boyars shorn of their beards and their prerogatives to the foreign captains of the new Russian navy. Here in these pages are the beautiful Anna Mons, Peter's first mistress; his wife Eudoxia, whom he never loved; and the peasant girl who eventually was to be crowned Empress Catherine the First. We see these men and women moving across a tapestry of battles abroad, and amid the dark, opulent luxury of the great families and the Imperial Court. In Tolstoy's moving crowded pages we see the emergence of Russia, thrust forward by Peter's inexorable will, from a backward medieval state to her final position as one of the great powers of Europe. Here are magnificent portraits, the fruits of years of historical research, of Peter's principal opponents: August, Elector of Saxony, indefatigable in his amusements, and King Charles XII of Sweden, a great military genius, flawed by passion and indulgence. But the true hero of Tolstoy's epic is Peter himself. We see him grow to be a man---awkward, suspicious, prone to spasms of cowardice, but always driving, sometimes provoked almost to madness, to free his country from the chains of backwardness and superstition to take her place as an equal among the nations of the west. And in the last analysis it is this greatness and originality of character in its hero which gives the stamp of greatness to the book itself. Alexey Tolstoy was born in 1883. In 1918 he published his first full length work, Nikita's Childhood. In 1919 he fled from the Bolshevik government and settled in Paris. In 1922 he asked for and received permission to return home. For the next twenty-four years he lived in Russia, until his death in 1946.","['Classics', 'Russia', 'History', 'Russian Literature', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Russian History', 'Nonfiction', '18th Century']"

After having narrowed his scope from the huge cosmic histories of Last and First Men (history of humanity) and Star Maker (history of the universe, Dante-esque cameo by God at the end) to the earthbound Odd John (super-man) and Sirius (super-dog), The Flames reads like an attempt to stuff them all into a 50-page novella. It's supremely confused, but the evident moroseness of an author who, in the face of a second world war, has decided that his imagination will not help, gives The Flames an immediacy that you never see in other top-flight fantasists like Borges.","['Science Fiction', 'Speculative Fiction']"

Lanterns on the Levee is his memorial to the South of his youth and young manhood. In describing life in the Mississippi Delta, Percy bridges the interval between the semifeudal South of the 1800s and the anxious South of the early 1940s. The rare qualities of this classic memoir lie not in what Will Percy did in his life -- although his life was exciting and varied -- but rather in the intimate, honest, and soul-probing record of how he brought himself to contemplate unflinchingly a new and unstable era. The 1973 introduction by Walker Percy -- Will's nephew and adopted son -- recalls the strong character and easy grace of ""the most extraordinary man I have ever known.""","['Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Southern', 'School', 'American', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult']"
Aminadab,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445745.Aminadab,"The world of Aminadab, Maurice Blanchot's second novel, is dark, bizarre, and fantastic. Reminiscent of Kafka's enclosed and allegorical spaces, Aminadab is both a reconstruction and a deconstruction of power, authority, and hierarchy. The novel opens when Thomas, upon seeing a woman gesture to him from a window of a large boarding house, enters the building and slowly becomes embroiled in its inscrutable workings. Although Thomas is constantly reassured that he can leave the building, he seems to be separated forever from the world he has left behind. The story consists of Thomas's frustrated attempts to clarify his status as a resident in the building and his misguided interactions with the cast of sickly, depraved, or in some way deformed characters he meets, none of them ever quite what they seem to be. Aminadab, the man who according to legend guards the entrance to the building's underground spaces, is only one of the mysteries reified by the rumors circulating among the residents.Written in a prose that is classical and at times lyrical, Blanchot's novel functions as an allegory referring, above all, to the wandering and striving movement of writing itself.","['France', 'Fiction']"
I Spit on Your Graves,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766860.I_Spit_on_Your_Graves,"Boris Vian was a novelist, jazz musician, jazz critic, poet, playwright, a friend of Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Raymond Queneau, Jean Cocteau, Louis Malle, Jean Paul Sartre, and numerous others of forties and fifties Parisian cultural society. He was also a French translator of American hard-boiled crime novels. One of his discoveries was an African-American writer by the name of Vernon Sullivan. Vian translated Sullivan's I Spit on Your Graves. The book is about a 'white Negro' who acts out an act of revenge against a small Southern town, in repayment for the death of his brother, who was lynched by an all white mob. Upon its release, I Spit on Your Graves became a bestseller in France, as well as a instruction manual for a copycat killer whose copy of I Spit on Your Graves was found by the murdered body of a prostitute with certain violent passages underlined. A censorship trail also came up where Sullivan as the author was held responsible for the material. It was later disclosed that Vian himself wrote the book and made up the identity of Vernon Sullivan!This edition is a translation by Vian, that was never published in America. I Spit on Your Graves is an extremely violent sexy hard-boiled novel about racial and class prejudice, revenge, justice, and is itself a literary oddity due to the fact that it was written by a jazz-loving white Frenchman, who had never been to America.","['Fiction', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Classics', 'Crime', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Noir', '20th Century']"

The Work of Fire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233351.The_Work_of_Fire,"Since the middle of the twentieth century, Maurice Blanchot has been an extraordinarily influential figure on the French literary and cultural scene. He is arguably the key figure after Sartre in exploring the relation between literature and philosophy. Blanchot early developed a distinctive, limpid firm of essay writing, and, apart from his fiction, his main work has appeared as collections of essays. His essays, in form and substance, unmistakably left their imprint on the work of the most inluential of French theorists. The writings of Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida, for example, are hardly imaginable without Blanchot, and, indeed, all three have generously paid tribute to him. Published in French in 1949, The Work of Fire is a collection of 22 essays originally issued as review essays in literary journals. Certain themes return again and the relation of literature and language to death; the sigificance of repetition; the historical, personal, and social function of literature; and perhaps most important, simply the question, What is at stake in the fact that something such as art or literature exists? Within each essay, Blanchot raises anew these central themes in the context of a particular work or a particular author. He has read, it appears, practically everything, and an essay on a given writer or work will bristle with apposite references to other authors and works. Among the authors discussed in The Work of Fire are Kafka, Mallarme, Holderlin, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Sartre, Gide, Pascal, Valery, Hemingway, Henry Miller, and such lesser figures as Benjamin Constant and Jean Paulhan. The essays demonstrate Blanchot's ability to pose the most lucid questions about the essence of literature while saying something new and probing about the author or work in question.","['Philosophy', 'France', 'Theory', '20th Century', 'Essays', 'Academic', 'Literary Criticism', 'Nonfiction']"

But working underground, persecuted by the police, is an organization dedicated to the overthrow of government and the existing way of life and the establishment of freedom'.

They were well equipped and trained for their job and had friends and informers in high places ready to reveal where the wealth of the nobles was hidden.

But Alar had amnesia and did not know his true identity though sometimes he sensed that there was a purpose in his actions that was not entirely his own volition. When Keiris, wife of the Imperial Chancellor saw him, she sensed that he was something special and helped him to elude pursuit even though it put her own life in danger. And in trips to the Moon and even the Sun itself, Alar begins to see what part he is destined to play in the struggle for men's freedom.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction']"

Faux Pas,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634167.Faux_Pas,"Published in France in 1943, Faux Pas is the first collection of Maurice Blanchot's essays on literature and language, consisting of fifty-four short pieces that were originally issued as reviews in literary journals, and one long introductory meditation that defines the trajectory of the whole volume. These essays―like those collected in the other five books of criticism published over several decades―have established Blanchot as the most lucid and powerful French critic of the second half of the twentieth century. Sober reconstructions of the main tenets of both classical and modern, both literary and theoretical texts, they have attained the status of model readings for authors as diverse as da Vinci and Kierkegaard, Melville and Proust, Molière, Goethe, and Mallarmé. However, the book is not a miscellaneous collection of exquisite essays. The first section of the volume, ""From Anguish to Language,"" indicates the relative unity of its trajectory and its special moment in the development of Blanchot's thought. ""Anguish"" was a prominent notion for the existentialist philosophies of the period of his first work, and in this book Blanchot reflects on the necessary transition from the paradoxes of anguish to a focus on the paradoxes of language. He does so without ever betraying the affective tensions that attach themselves to linguistic utterances, but he also insists that the pathos of anxiety is, in the last resort, comical. Whoever writes ""I am lonely"" can judge himself to be quite comical, as he evokes his solitude by addressing a reader and using means that make it impossible to be alone. This comedy of language is retraced in Blanchot's intensely luminous essays on poetry and narration, on silence and symbolism, the novel and morals, the stranger, the enigma, time, and the very possibility of literature in the works of Blake, Balzac, Rimbaud, and Gide, Bergson and Brice Parain, Rilke and Bataille, Sartre, Camus, Queneau, and so many others.","['France', 'Literary Criticism', 'Philosophy']"

Abraham Lincoln's World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104297.Abraham_Lincoln_s_World,"1945 Newbery Honor TitleWith her whimsical and informative illustrations and timelines, Foster has magnificently captured a remarkable age and a remarkable man. The author earned her reputation by her masterful display of ""horizontal history"" telling the story of world events in the geo-political sphere, while giving as much importance to advances in science, medicine, music, art, literature, and exploration.Thus, while Abe Lincoln was a boy romping the woods of Kentucky, Thomas Jefferson was completing his eighth year as president, George III reigned in Great Britain and Napolean was about to meet his Waterloo. Beethoven and Sir Walter Scott were at the height of their creative powers, while Victor Hugo was staging plays at school. By the time Lincoln was old enough to help his father chop wood, other young boys and girls were being prepared for the future parts they would play. Harriet Beecher was reading anything she could get her hands on, Charles Darwin was collecting toads, crabs and shells, and the impoverished boy Dickens was working in a shoe blacking factory in London.When Lincoln opened his shop in Salem, David Livingstone was exploring Africa, and thousands of Americans were opening up the West on the Oregon Trail. The spirit of freedom was moving around the globe as the abolitionist movement gained power in the States and serfdom saw its demise in Russia. Technologically the world was bursting with the invention of the telegraph, the railroad and the steamboat.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'School', 'Biography', 'Childrens', 'American History', 'Read For School', 'Historical', 'Kids', 'Civil War']"

Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3028.Economics_in_One_Lesson,"A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote , his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of . Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make , every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Money', 'Classics', 'Audiobook']"

Nine Suitcases: A Memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2237906.Nine_Suitcases,"Suppressed by the Communists for nearly forty years and never before published in English, Nine Suitcases is one of the first—and greatest—memoirs of the Holocaust ever written. Originally published in Hungary in weekly installments starting in 1946, it tells the harrowing story of Béla Zsolt’s experiences in the ghetto and as a forced laborer in the Ukraine. It gives not only a rare insight into Hungarian fascism, but also a shocking exposure to the cruelty, indifference, selfishness, cowardice and betrayal of which human beings—the victims no less than the perpetrators—are capable in extreme circumstances.Apart from being one of the earliest writers on the Holocaust, Zsolt is also one of the most powerful. He bears comparison with Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, or Imre Kertész. Both an accomplished novelist and a highly skilled journalist, he was reporting and analyzing these appalling events soon after they occurred with exceptional clarity and a devastating blend of angry despair and cool detachment.Zsolt was spared Auschwitz, but he witnessed and suffered some of the worst atrocities of the Holocaust elsewhere; his nightmarish but meticulously realistic chronicle of smaller and larger crimes against humanity is as riveting as it is horrifying. The rediscovery and publication of Nine Suitcases is an event of great historical importance.","['Holocaust', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'War', 'Hungary', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']"

Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131885.Fearful_Symmetry,"Published in 1947, Fearful Symmetry was Northrop Frye's first book and the product of over a decade of intense labour. Drawing readers into the imaginative world of William Blake, Frye succeeded in making Blake's voice and vision intelligible to the wider public. Distinguished by its range of reference, elegance of expression, comprehensiveness of coverage, coherence of argument, and sympathy to its subject, Fearful Symmetry was immediately recognized as a landmark of Blake criticism. Fifty years later, it is still recognized as having ensured the acceptance of Blake as a canonical poet by permanently dispelling the widespread notion that he was the mad creator of an incomprehensible private symbolism.For this new edition, the text has been revised and corrected in accordance with the principles of the Collected Works of Northrop Frye series. Frye's original annotation has been supplemented with references to currently standard editions of Blake and others, and many new notes have been provided, identifying quotations, allusions, and cultural references. An introduction by Ian Singer provides biographical and critical context for the book, an overview of its contents, and an account of its reception.","['Poetry', 'Literary Criticism', 'Nonfiction', 'Criticism', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Writing', 'Romanticism', 'History']"

When he suggests they rent Wisteria Cottage, a charming seaside residence, it seems to promise a summer of pleasant companionship and fun. What the Hacketts don’t know is that Richard is a deeply troubled individual, recently released from a mental institution, and that their relaxing summer holiday will soon turn into a terrifying nightmare....A brilliant psychological examination of criminal insanity, Robert M. Coates’s Wisteria Cottage (1948) earned rave reviews on its initial publication and was adapted for the 1958 film noir Edge of Fury.
