Lord of the Flies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies,"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'Adventure']"

East of Eden,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden,"In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', '20th Century']"

How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113946.How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_,"""The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing!

The Crucible: A Play in Four Acts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible,"""I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,"" Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Historical', 'High School', 'Literature', 'Theatre']"

The Illustrated Man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24830.The_Illustrated_Man,"That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work.

In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope,"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or ""Zero Hour,"" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children.

She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile, and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep, and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts, or to tear the wings from nightingales.So begins James Thurber s sublimely revamped fairy tale, The 13 Clocks, in which a wicked Duke who imagines he has killed time, and the Duke s beautiful niece, for whom time seems to have run out, both meet their match, courtesy of an enterprising and very handsome prince in disguise. Readers young and old will take pleasure in this tale of love forestalled but ultimately fulfilled, admiring its upstanding hero ( He yearned to find in a far land the princess of his dreams, singing as he went, and possibly slaying a dragon here and there ) and unapologetic villain ( We all have flaws, the Duke said. Mine is being wicked ), while wondering at the enigmatic Golux, the mysterious stranger whose unpredictable interventions speed the story to its necessarily happy end.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Childrens', 'Humor', 'Young Adult', 'Fairy Tales', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Juvenile']"

Lucky Jim,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395182.Lucky_Jim,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found hereRegarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century, Lucky Jim remains as trenchant, withering, and eloquently misanthropic as when it first scandalized readers back in 1954. This is the story of Jim Dixon, a hapless lecturer in medieval history at a provincial university who knows better than most that “there was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.” Kingsley Amis’s scabrous debut leads the reader through a gallery of emphatically English bores, cranks, frauds, and neurotics with whom Dixon must contend in one way or another in order to hold on to his cushy academic perch and win the girl of his fancy.More than just a merciless satire of cloistered college life and stuffy postwar manners, is an attack on the forces of boredom, whatever form they may take, and a work of art that at once distills and extends an entire tradition of English comic writing, from Fielding and Dickens through Wodehouse and Waugh. As Christopher Hitchens has written, “If you can picture Bertie or Jeeves being capable of actual malice, and simultaneously imagine Evelyn Waugh forgetting about original sin, you have the combination of innocence and experience that makes this short romp so imperishable.”","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Comedy', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Modern Classics']"

Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121732.Surprised_by_Joy,"Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life is a partial autobiography describing Lewis' conversion to Christianity. The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify & describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of & consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht, longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain.However, while he does describe his life, the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good & so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913, aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous & uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism & then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature & purpose of Joy & its place in his own life.The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described, though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence, remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem, ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind"", relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.","['Christian', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Memoir', 'Theology', 'Faith', 'Classics', 'Autobiography']"

Junky,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23940.Junky,"Before his 1959 breakthrough, Naked Lunch, an unknown William S. Burroughs wrote Junky, his first novel. It is a candid eye-witness account of times and places that are now long gone, an unvarnished field report from the American post-war underground. Unafraid to portray himself in 1953 as a confirmed member of two socially-despised under classes (a narcotics addict and a homosexual), Burroughs was writing as a trained anthropologist when he unapologetically described a way of life - in New York, New Orleans, and Mexico City - that by the 1940's was already demonized by the artificial anti-drug hysteria of an opportunistic bureaucracy and a cynical, prostrate media. For this fiftieth-anniversary edition, eminent Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris has painstakingly recreated the author's original text, word by word, from archival typescripts and places the book's contents against a lively historical background in a comprehensive introduction. Here as well, for the first time, are Burroughs' own unpublished introduction and an entire omitted chapter, along with many ""lost"" passages, as well as auxiliary texts by Allen Ginsberg and others.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', '20th Century', 'Contemporary', 'The United States Of America', 'Modern Classics', 'LGBT']"

The Origins of Totalitarianism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396931.The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism,"Hannah Arendt's definitive work on totalitarianism and an essential component of any study of twentieth-century political historyThe Origins of Totalitarianism begins with the rise of anti-Semitism in central and western Europe in the 1800s and continues with an examination of European colonial imperialism from 1884 to the outbreak of World War I. Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time—Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia—which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Political Science', 'Sociology', 'Classics', 'Theory', 'Psychology', 'Germany']"

When he regains consciousness, he is in a fantasy world of Old Testament morality gone awry—a place of instant plagues, immediate damnations, and death to all perceived infidels. Hamilton figures out how he and his compatriots can escape this world and return to their own, but first they must pass through three other vividly fantastical worlds, each more perilous and hilarious than the one before.Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'American', 'Dystopia', 'Horror', '20th Century']"

Andersonville,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77239.Andersonville,"Acclaimed as the greatest novel ever written about the War Between the States, this searing Pulitzer Prize-winning book captures all the glory and shame of America's most tragic conflict in the vivid, crowded world of Andersonville, and the people who lived outside its barricades. Based on the author's extensive research and nearly 25 years in the making, MacKinlay Kantor's best-selling masterwork tells the heartbreaking story of the notorious Georgia prison where 50,000 Northern soldiers suffered - and 14,000 died - and of the people whose lives were changed by the grim camp where the best and the worst of the Civil War came together. Here is the savagery of the camp commandant, the deep compassion of a nearby planter and his gentle daughter, the merging of valor and viciousness within the stockade itself, and the day-to-day fight for survival among the cowards, cutthroats, innocents, and idealists thrown together by the brutal struggle between North and South. A moving portrait of the bravery of people faced with hopeless tragedy, this is the inspiring American classic of an unforgettable period in American history.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Civil War', 'War', 'Classics', 'American Civil War', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Banned Books', 'Military Fiction']"

Hangsaman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131177.Hangsaman,"Hangsaman is Miss Jackson's second novel. The story is a simple one but the overtones are immediately present. ""Natalie Waite who was seventeen years old but who felt that she had been truly conscious only since she was about fifteen lived in an odd corner of a world of sound and sight, past the daily voices of her father and mother and their incomprehensible actions."" In a few graphic pages, the family is before us—Arnold Waite, a writer, egotistical and embittered; his wife, the complaining martyr; Bud, the younger brother who has not yet felt the need to establish his independence; and Natalie, in the nightmare of being seventeen.The Sunday afternoon cocktail party, to which Arnold Waite has invited his literary friends and neighbors, serves to etch in the details of this family's life, and to draw Natalie into the vortex. The story concentrates on the next few critical months in Natalie's life, away at college, where each experience reproduces on a larger scale the crucial failure of her emotional life at home. With a mounting tension rising from character and situation as well as the particular magic of which Miss Jackson is master, the novel proceeds inexorably to the stinging melodrama of its conclusion. The bitter cruelty of the passage from adolescence to womanhood, of a sensitive and lonely girl caught in a world not of her own devising, is a theme well suited to Miss Jackson's brilliant talent.","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Mystery', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'American']"

Watt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104613.Watt,"Fiction. WATT was the beginning of Samuel Becket's post-war literary career, the fruition of the years in hiding in the Vaucluse mountains from the Gestapo, which also largely inspired WAITING FOR GODOT. But it remains, unlike the work that followed it, extremely Irish, a philosophical novel full of the grim humour that was already his trade-mark in such earlier fictions as MORE PRICKS THAN KICKS and MURPHY. The perambulations of WATT, especially in the home of the eccentric Mr. Knott, and the sketching of logic to elicit meaning, must be among the most comic inventions of modern literature. First published by the libertine Olympia Press in 1953, it has established itself as one of the most quoted and best-loved of Becket's novels.

Fans of Please Don't Eat the Daisies, Cheaper by the Dozen, and anything Erma Bombeck ever wrote will find much to recognize in Shirley Jackson's home and neighborhood: children who won't behave, cars that won't start, furnaces that break down, a pugnacious corner bully, household help that never stays, and a patient, capable husband who remains lovingly oblivious to the many thousands of things mothers and wives accomplish every single day.""Our house,"" writes Jackson, ""is old, noisy, and full. When we moved into it we had two children and about five thousand books; I expect that when we finally overflow and move out again we will have perhaps twenty children and easily half a million books."" Jackson's literary talents are in evidence everywhere, as is her trenchant, unsentimental wit. Yet there is no mistaking the happiness and love in these pages, which are crowded with the raucous voices of an extraordinary family living a wonderfully ordinary life.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Classics', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Parenting', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Family']"

The volume ends in the year 1921, when Trotsky, then at the climax of his power, unwittingly sowed the seeds of his own defeat.","['History', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Russia', 'Nonfiction', 'Russian History', 'Russian Revolution', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Soviet History']"

Why begrudge expenditure on vital public works while ignoring waste and extravagance in the private sector of the economy?

Lady Sings the Blues,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/290112.Lady_Sings_the_Blues,"With photosOriginally released by Doubleday in 1956, Harlem Moon Classics celebrates the publication with the fiftieth-anniversary edition of Billie Holiday’s unforgettable and timeless memoir. Updated with an insightful introduction and a revised discography, both written by celebrated music writer David Ritz.Lady Sings the Blues is the fiercely honest, no-holds-barred autobiography of Billie Holiday, the legendary jazz, swing, and standards singing sensation. Taking the reader on a fast-moving journey from Holiday’s rough-and-tumble Baltimore childhood (where she ran errands at a whorehouse in exchange for the chance to listen to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith albums), to her emergence on Harlem’s club scene, to sold-out performances with the Count Basie Orchestra and with Artie Shaw and his band, this revelatory memoir is notable for its trenchant observations on the racism that darkened Billie’s life and the heroin addiction that ended it too soon. We are with her during the mesmerizing debut of “Strange Fruit”; with her as she rubs shoulders with the biggest movie stars and musicians of the day (Bob Hope, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and more); and with her through the scrapes with Jim Crow, spats with Sarah Vaughan, ignominious jailings, and tragic decline. All of this is told in Holiday’s tart, streetwise style and hip patois that makes it read as if it were written yesterday.","['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Jazz', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'African American', 'Womens']"

The Village,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1238734.The_Village,"The Village, first published in 1952, begins on the very day the war ended. Two women, who have been firm friends during the war, go as usual to the Red Cross Post. Here they spend the night as they always had done, chatting over a cup of tea. As dawn breaks they lock the door 'but still they lingered, unwilling finally to end this night and the years behind it.""There's a lot of us will miss it,"" Edith said. ""We've all of us felt at times, you know, how nice it was, like you and me being able to be together and friendly, just as if we were the same sort, if you know what I mean."" ""I'll miss it a lot too,"" Wendy said. There was no point in her saying that it could go on now, the friendliness and the companionship and the simple human liking of one woman for another. Both knew that this breaking down of social barriers was just one of the things you got out of the war, but it couldn't go on.'The main theme of The Village is that Wendy's attempt to cling on to her old way of life was already under pressure by 1939 and had become even more out-of-date by 1945. It is Edith who is the New Britain, with her prosperous son and her commonsense and indeed kindness. Wendy, with her snobbery and her refusal to change and her uncompromising attitude to her daugher, is the Old.When Labour swept to a landslide victory in 1945 'Attlee's government promised a fairer future for all and no going back to the inequalities of the pre-war world,' writes Juliet Gardiner in her Afterword to this Persephone edition of The Village. When Wendy goes back up the road to Wood View on Priory Hill 'where the gentry lived' and Edith goes downhill on the other side, 'down Station Road among the working classes', they both assume that the values and habits of pre-war Britain will continue. But Britain has already changed a great deal, a change symbolised by Edith's son Roy, a printer with excellent prospects, falling in love with the penniless Margaret, Wendy's daughter.'The story of the romance between the two of them forms the central narrative of the novel,' Juliet Gardiner continues, 'and the attitude of the other villagers when the news gets out illuminates their understanding - or rejection - of the village's elaborately calibrated social stratification. This is a finely-observed novel about the losses and gains of the Second World War, how hopeless and how isolating it would be to hold onto the past, how illusory was the notion that the war had broken down class barriers, or had managed to save ""deep England"" from the future and how peace, too, would produce its own list of casualties. It is also about the futility of 'keeping up appearances', the boredom of middle-class women with nothing to do, even the realisation that cooking and housework had to be streamlined if theose women were to take their place in society. But above all The Village is an extremely enjoyable and well-written novel evoking an entire community (there is a long cast of characters at the beginning) and a whole way of life, and has one of the most ancient plots in the world - a young couple who fall in love but are forbidden to marry.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Modern Classics', 'Romance', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'World War II', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']"

Milly has been in some way disgraced… Once again the chaise-longue is the hinge between the two planes of existence.

The Unnamable,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78457.The_Unnamable,"The Unnamable consists entirely of a disjointed monologue from the perspective of an unnamed (presumably unnamable) and immobile protagonist. There is no concrete plot or setting - and whether the other characters (""Mahood"" (formerly ""Basil"") and ""Worm"") actually exist or whether they are facets of the narrator himself is debatable. The protagonist also claims authorship of the main characters in the two previous novels of the Trilogy and Beckett's earlier novels Murphy, Mercier and Camier, and Watt. The novel is a mix of recollections and existential musings on the part of its narrator, many of which pertain specifically to the possibility that the narrator is constructed by the language he speaks. Other 'characters' (a stretch to call them distinctly different than the narrator) serve as the passive recipient of the dialogue and in many places (as the narrator suggests) the dialogue's genesis. The novel builds in its despairing tone until the ending, which consists mainly of very long run-on sentences. It closes with the phrase ""I can't go on, I'll go on,"" which was later used as the title of an anthology of Beckett works.The Unnamable is a 1953 novel by Samuel Beckett. It is the third and final entry in Beckett's ""Trilogy"" of novels, which begins with Molloy followed by Malone Dies. It was originally published in French as L'Innommable and later translated by the author into English.

Simple in its fundamentals, infinitely complex in its execution, Go is an essential expression of the Japanese spirit. And in his fictional chronicle of a match played between a revered and heretofore invincible Master and a younger, more modern challenger, Yasunari Kawabata captured the moment in which the immutable traditions of imperial Japan met the onslaught of the twentieth century.The competition between the Master of Go and his opponent, Otaké, is waged over several months and layered in ceremony. But beneath the game’s decorum lie tensions that consume not only the players themselves but their families and retainers—tensions that turn this particular contest into a duel that can only end in death. Luminous in its detail, both suspenseful and serene, is written with the poetic economy and psychological acumen that brought Kawabata the Nobel Prize for Literature.","['Fiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Go', 'Asia', 'Nobel Prize', 'Games', 'Historical Fiction']"

They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/978689.They_Thought_They_Were_Free,"“When this book was first published it received some attention from the critics but none at all from the public. Nazism was finished in the bunker in Berlin and its death warrant signed on the bench at Nuremberg.” That’s Milton Mayer, writing in a foreword to the 1966 edition of They Thought They Were Free. He’s right about the critics: the book was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1956. General readers may have been slower to take notice, but over time they did—what we’ve seen over decades is that any time people, across the political spectrum, start to feel that freedom is threatened, the book experiences a ripple of word-of-mouth interest. And that interest has never been more prominent or potent than what we’ve seen in the past year. is an eloquent and provocative examination of the development of fascism in Germany. Mayer’s book is a study of ten Germans and their lives from 1933-45, based on interviews he conducted after the war when he lived in Germany. Mayer had a position as a research professor at the University of Frankfurt and lived in a nearby small Hessian town which he disguised with the name “Kronenberg.” “These ten men were not men of distinction,” Mayer noted, but they had been members of the Nazi Party; Mayer wanted to discover what had made them Nazis. His discussions with them of Nazism, the rise of the Reich, and mass complicity with evil became the backbone of this book, an indictment of the ordinary German that is all the more powerful for its refusal to let the rest of us pretend that our moment, our society, our country are fundamentally immune. A new foreword to this edition by eminent historian of the Reich Richard J. Evans puts the book in historical and contemporary context. We live in an age of fervid politics and hyperbolic rhetoric. cuts through that, revealing instead the slow, quiet accretions of change, complicity, and abdication of moral authority that quietly mark the rise of evil.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'World War II', 'Germany', 'War', 'Psychology', 'Holocaust', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']"

Suddenly Last Summer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161915.Suddenly_Last_Summer,"Kerr, in the NY Herald-Tribune, describes: ""This, says Mr. Williams through the most sympathetic voice among his characters, 'is a true story about the time and the world we live in.' He has made it seem true-or at least curiously and suspensefully possible-by the extraordinary skill with which he has wrung detail after detail out of a young woman who has lived with horror. Anne Meacham, as a girl who has been the sole witness to her cousin's unbelievably shocking death, is brought into a 'planned jungle' of a New Orleans garden to confront a family that is intensely interested in having her deny the lurid tale she has told. The post-dilettante's mother is, indeed, so ruthlessly eager to suppress the facts that she had the girl incarcerated in a mental institution and she is perfectly willing, once she finishes her ritualistic five o'clock frozen daiquiri, to order the performance of a frontal lobotomy. A nun stands in rigid attendance; a doctor prepares a hypodermic to force the truth; greedy relatives beg her to recant in return for solid cash. Under the assorted, and thoroughly fascinating, pressures that are brought to bear, and under the intolerable, stammering strain of reliving her own memories, Miss Meacham slowly, painfully, hypnotically paints a concrete and blistering portrait of loneliness.of the sudden snapping of that spider's web that is one man's life, of ultimate panic and futile flight. The very reluctance with which the grim, hopeless narrative is unfolded binds us to it; Mr. Williams threads it out with a spare, sure, sharply vivid control of language.and the spell is cast.""","['Plays', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'American', 'Southern', '20th Century', 'Southern Gothic', 'School']"

Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375701.Aku_Aku,"Aku-Aku, the Secret of Easter Island describes Thor Heyerdahl's research at Rano Raraku & Anakena on their many giant stone statues. The book & later film made a major contribution to awareness, outside anthropological & archeological communities, of both the island & the statues. Much of his evidence has now been refuted by archeologists. His methods have been criticised. Paul Bahn wrote: ""he relied on the selective use of evidence, which resulted in a misleading conclusion"".Heyerdahl is most controversially associated with an attempt to revive the theory that the islanders' stone carving technology came from S. America. He argued that as well as being settled by Polynesians, Easter Island was settled by people from Peru, an area described as ""more culturally developed"".""Aku-aku"" refers to moving a tall, flat bottomed object by swiveling it alternatively on its corners in a walking fashion. Heyerdahl theorised the Easter Island Moai (statues) were moved in this fashion, & tested this on a small Moai--tho the test was abandoned after the Moai's base was damaged. He also asserts that for the islanders, Aku Aku means a ""spiritual guide.""Heyerdahl compared the highest quality stonework on the island to pre-Columbian Amerindian stonework such as at Tihuanaco. Seemingly unaware of Polynesian stoneworking traditions such as the Marae he said of Ahu Vinapu's retaining wall ""No Polynesian fisherman would have been capable of conceiving, much less building such a wall"". However Alfred Metraux had already pointed out that the rubble filled Rapanui walls were of a fundamentally different design to those of the Inca.Heyerdahl claimed a S. American origin for some Easter Island plants including the Totora reeds in the islands' three crater lakes which are now recognised as a separate species to the ones in Lake Titicaca. Also the Sweet Potato, which is now reckoned to have been in Polynesia before Easter Island was settled.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Travel', 'Adventure', 'Anthropology', 'Archaeology', 'Science', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Geography']"

On the Abolition of All Political Parties,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20447761-on-the-abolition-of-all-political-parties,"A brilliant woman who was a study in fiercely maintained contradictions, a star student who went to work on a factory line, a Jewish convert to Catholicism who insisted on refusing baptism, Simone Weil is one of the most intransigent and taxing of spiritual masters, always willing to push her thinking—and us—one step beyond the apparently reasonable in pursuit of the one truth, the one good. She asks hard questions and avoids easy answers. In this essay—now in English for the first time—she challenges the foundation of the modern liberal political order, making an argument that will have particular resonance in present-day America. Examining the dynamic of power and propaganda caused by party spirit, the increasing disregard for truth in favor of opinion, and the consequent corruption of education, journalism, and art, Weil proposes that politics can only begin where the party spirit comes to an end.This volume also reprints an admiring portrait of Weil by the Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz and an essay about Weil’s friendship with Albert Camus by the translator Simon Leys.Quotes:At a time when the distrust and disenchantment Americans feel with politics runs deeper than the Mariana Trench, Weil’s essay ‘On the Abolition of All Political Parties’ would no doubt be a best seller.—Robert Zaretsky, from “Recalling the Apostle of Nonpartisanship,” The New York TimesWhat makes her thought so special, so bracing and so strange, is its combination of philosophical rigour and spiritual compass…Only a saint could withstand the pressure to conform to the prefabricated morality of the political realm; only a genius could formulate an idea outside the ‘for’ or ‘against’ thinking so long inculcated by party politics that it has become a kind of ‘intellectual leprosy.’ The tone and texture of this vivid editorial, however, renews a certainty that Weil was both.—The AustralianWeil’s writing is unusual and compelling, in part, because it is both quite strictly rational and eccentrically spiritual. Her argumentation is so compact, so holistic, each sentence and paragraph building methodically on its predecessor, that trying to précis her is probably futile. To omit anything from a summary of her writing is to short-change her. She writes modestly and without flair, but her words all but radiate moral and intellectual conviction.—Australian Book Review[Source: http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints...]","['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'France', 'History', '20th Century', 'Theory', 'Political Science', 'Sociology']"

The Lark,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/837713.The_Lark,"Chapman, writing in the New York News called The Lark: ""a beautiful, beautiful play It is always the story of a simple girl who became an inspired warrior and then was tried by the church but there have been several ways of telling it. Anouilh's way, and Miss Hellman's, is to try to tell the story from two viewpoints. One of them is how we look at the tale now as a piece of history, with our knowledge of how the girl's blundering captors unwittingly created a martyr who became forever a symbol of courage and faith. The other viewpoint has been to try to imagine what it must have been like to be Joan herself. Both approaches to this legend of the Martyr of Rouen have been splendidly realized by the technique of divorcing the drama from the confinements of time, sequence and space. Until the last moment a thrilling and uplifting one of Joan's greatest earthly triumph, the coronation of the worthless Dauphin for whom she fought there is no scenery in the usual sense, merely a few levels of steps and platforms, and lights. With this freedom, the story of Joan of Arc can move backward or forward without an interruption, without a jar. It begins with Joan's trial, and her tale of the voices which prompted her one day to set forth and save France from the English. And as she tells her listeners the cold Inquisitor from Spain, the politically cynical Earl of Warwick, the deeply religious but ineffectual Cauchon and all the others of what she heard and what she did, her story comes alive.""","['Plays', 'Drama', 'France', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'French Literature', 'School']"
River of Fire:,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/902366.River_of_Fire,"Never before available in English, River of Fire, originally published as Aag ka Darya in 1959, is without question the most important novel of 20th-century Urdu literature. An amazing, sui generis book, River of Fire spans two and a half millennia. Set during four Indian epochs (the classical, the medieval, the colonial, and the modern post-national), the novel is a meditation on history and human nature, tracing four souls through time. Each section is linked by characters who bear, in every period, the same names: Gautam, Champa, Kamal, and Cyril. Gautam (appearing first as a student of mysticism at the Forest University of Shravasti in the 4th century B.C.E.) and Champa (throughout embodying the enigmatic experience of Indian women) begin and end the novel; Muslim Kamal appears mid-way through, as the Muslims did, and loses himself in the Indian landscape; and Cyril, the Englishman, appears later still. In different eras, different relations from among the four -- romance and war, possession and dispossession. Yet together the characters reflect the oneness of human nature: amidst the nationalist and religious upheavals of Indian history, Hyder argues for a culture that is inclusive.Interweaving parables, legends, dreams, diaries, and letters, Hyder's prose is lyrical and witty. There is really no book like River of Fire. Qurratulain Hyder was awarded the Bharatiya Gnanpith, India's highest literary award, in 1989, and here is her masterpiece, her broadest canvas and her finest art.","['Fiction', 'India', 'Historical Fiction', 'Pakistan', 'Classics', 'Indian Literature', 'Asia', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Novels']"

The Outsider its an individual engaged in an intense self-exploration—a person who lives at the edge, challenges cultural values and ""stands for Truth."" Born into a world without perspective, where others simply drift thru life, the Outsider creates his own set of rules and lives them in an unsympathetic environment. The relative handful of people who fulfilled Wilson's definition of the Outsider in the 1950s have now become a significant social force, making Wilson's vision more relevant today than ever. Through the works the lives of various artists—including Kafka, Camus, Eliot, Hemingway, Hesse, Lawrence, Van Gogh, Nijinsky, Shaw, Blake, Nietzsche and Dostoyevski—Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society and society's effect on him. Wilson illuminates the struggle of those who seek not only the transformation of Self but also the transformation of society as a whole.

Mythologies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51715.Mythologies,"""No denunciation without its proper instrument of close analysis,"" Roland Barthes wrote in his preface to Mythologies. There is no more proper instrument of analysis of our contemporary myths than this book—one of the most significant works in French theory, and one that has transformed the way readers and philosophers view the world around them.Our age is a triumph of codification. We own devices that bring the world to the command of our fingertips. We have access to boundless information and prodigious quantities of stuff. We decide to like or not, to believe or not, to buy or not. We pick and choose. We think we are free. Yet all around us, in pop culture, politics, mainstream media, and advertising, there are codes and symbols that govern our choices. They are the fabrications of consumer society. They express myths of success, well-being, and happiness. As Barthes sees it, these myths must be carefully deciphered, and debunked.What Barthes discerned in mass media, the fashion of plastic, and the politics of postcolonial France applies with equal force to today's social networks, the iPhone, and the images of 9/11. This new edition of , complete and beautifully rendered by the Pulitzer Prize–winning poet, critic, and translator Richard Howard, is a consecration of Barthes's classic—a lesson in clairvoyance that is more relevant now than ever.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Theory', 'Mythology', 'France', 'Sociology', 'Literary Criticism', 'Semiotics', 'Criticism']"

The Liberal Imagination: Essays on Literature and Society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402292.The_Liberal_Imagination,"The Liberal Imagination is one of the most admired and influential works of criticism of the last century, a work that is not only a masterpiece of literary criticism but an important statement about politics and society. Published in 1950, one of the chillier moments of the Cold War, Trilling's essays examine the promise—and limits—of liberalism, challenging the complacency of a naïve liberal belief in rationality, progress, and the panaceas of economics and other social sciences, and asserting in their stead the irreducible complexity of human motivation and the tragic inevitability of tragedy. Only the imagination, Trilling argues, can give us access and insight into these realms and only the imagination can ground a reflective and considered, rather than programmatic and dogmatic, liberalism.Writing with acute intelligence about classics like and the novels of Henry James and F. Scott Fitzgerald, but also on such varied matters as the Kinsey Report and money in the American imagination, Trilling presents a model of the critic as both part of and apart from his society, a defender of the reflective life that, in our ever more rationalized world, seems ever more necessary—and ever more remote.","['Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Literary Criticism', 'Politics', 'Criticism', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'American', 'History', 'Theory']"

Here the focus is on the concepts of being & reason. Tillich shows how the quest for revelation is integral to reason itself. In the same way a description of the inner tensions of being leads to the recognition that the quest for God is implied in finite being. Here also Tillich defines his thought in relation to philosophy & the Bible & sets forth his famous doctrine of God as the ""Ground of Being."" Thus God is understood not as being existing beside other beings, but as being-itself or the power of being in everything.

Εδώ το τοπίο καταυγάζεται από την αρχετυπική παρουσία της γυναίκας, την Παναγία ""με τ’ αργυρά ματόκλαδα"", που συνυπάρχει πολύ ανθρώπινα με την κόρη του πεταλωτή αλλά και την ορφική μητέρα, τη Λήδα, ""που κλωσά τ’ αυγά του κεραυνού"", τη Νιόβη, με τα ""επτά σφαγμένα παλικάρια"" της, τη Σολωμική ελευθερία, ""που θα πάρει πάλι τ’ άρματα"" και την Περσεφόνη που μοιράζει σπορά και γονιμότητα. Όλες αυτές οι γυναικείες μορφές συγκλίνουν στη μορφή της μητέρας Ελλάδας.Η ενότητα ΙΙΙ τονίζει ιδιαίτερα τη διαχρονικότητα της ρωμαίικης ζωής και τη διαρκή αγωνιστική ετοιμότητά της. Εδώ η ιστορία υφαίνεται μ’ ένα όνομα από τρεις χιλιάδες χρόνια μ’ έναν άγιο, με μια κόκκινη γοργόνα, αλλά και με την μυθική παρουσία του Προμηθέα σ’ ένα ανακυκλούμενο αιώνιο γίγνεσθαι.Η ενότητα ΙV περιγράφει την αγωνιστική πορεία, ""δέντρο το δέντρο, πέτρα την πέτρα, πέρασαν τον κόσμο"", και την άδοξη κατάληξή της, ""και τούτοι μεσ’ τα σίδερα και κείνοι μεσ’ το χώμα"", αλλά και την πεποίθηση για την τελική απολύτρωση.Η ενότητα V σκιαγραφεί το αίσθημα της καταστροφής και της ερήμωσης του μαρτυρικού τόπου αλλά και την προσδοκία της παλιννόστησης της ζωής. Τότε, ""θα διαβάσουμε όλη την καρδιά τους"" (των μαρτύρων της ελευθερίας)""σαν να διαβάζουμε από την αρχή την ιστορία του κόσμου"".Η ενότητα VI αποδίδει παραστατικότερα την εφιαλτική πραγματικότητα του εμφύλιου σπαραγμού και του θανάτου αλλά και την επιμονή στη συνέχιση της ζωής και του αγώνα. Μόνο ""για τα ψηλά είναι ακόμα δρόμος"".Τέλος η VII ενότητα προβάλλει και πάλι την ταυτότητα του τόπου και των ανθρώπων, που μέσα από τη γνώση του θανάτου προχωρούν με περισσότερη σιγουριά προς τη ζωή και την αγάπη, πέρα από τους διαχωρισμούς του πολέμου.",['Poetry']

Lost Splendor: The Amazing Memoirs of the Man Who Killed Rasputin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179709.Lost_Splendor,"From the rear cover of this 314 page ""Born to great riches, master of vast feudal estates and many palaces, Felix Youssoupoff led the life of a grand lord in the days before the Russian Revolution. Married to a niece of Czar Nicholas II, he could observe at close range the rampant corruption and intrigues of the imperial court, which culminated in the rise to power of the sinister monk Rasputin. Finally, impelled by patriotism and his love for the Romanoff dynasty, which he felt was in danger of destroying itself and Russia, he killed Rasputin in 1916 with the help of the Grand Duke Dimitri and others. More than any other single event, the assassination of Rasputin helped to bring about the cataclysmic upheaval that ended in the advent of the Soviet regime. In 1919, the Youssoupoffs left Russia. They sold two Rembrandt paintings (now in the National Gallery in Washington), as well as Princess Irina's jewelry. Contesting their portrayal in an MGM film and a CBS television drama, both dealing with Rasputin, they subsequently won large libel settlements in 1934 and 1965. Prince Youssoupoff, speaking about his wife to a magazine reporter, said 'Isn't she beautiful? We live as happily together as we did the first day......This is love, true love - something I've felt for no one but her'.""","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Romanovs', 'Biography Memoir', 'Russian History', 'Russian Literature']"

Letters and Papers from Prison,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/760019.Letters_and_Papers_from_Prison,"One of the great classics of prison literature, Letters and Papers from Prison effectively serves as the last will and testament of the Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a young German pastor who was executed by the Nazis in 1945 for his part in the “officers’ plot” to assassinate Adolf Hitler.This expanded version of Letters and Papers from Prison shifts the emphasis of earlier editions of Bonhoeffer’s theological reflections to the private sphere of his life. His letters appear in greater detail and show his daily concerns. Letters from Bonhoeffer’s parents, siblings, and other relatives have also been added, in addition to previously inaccessible letters and legal papers referring to his trial.Acute and subtle, warm and perceptive, yet also profoundly moving, the documents collectively tell a very human story of loss, of courage, and of hope. Bonhoeffer’s story seems as vitally relevant, as politically prophetic, and as theologically significant today, as it did yesterday.","['Theology', 'Religion', 'Christian', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Christianity', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Faith']"

The Singing Wilderness,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240004.The_Singing_Wilderness,"Sigurd F. Olson was for more than thirty years a wilderness guide in the Quetico-Superior country, and no one knew with the same intimacy the mysteries of the lakes and forests of that magnificent primitive area. To the many out-of-doorsmen who canoed and portaged with him through this wilderness, he was known honorifically as the Bourgeois--as the voyageurs of old called their trusted leaders through this same region.","['Nature', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Environment', 'Outdoors', 'Memoir', 'Conservation', 'History', 'Classics', 'Travel']"
Beetlecreek,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/505027.Beetlecreek,"After several years of silence and seclusion in Beetlecreek’s black quarter, a carnival worker named Bill Trapp befriends Johnny Johnson, a Pittsburgh teenager living with relatives in Beetlecreek. Bill is white. Johnny is black. Both are searching for acceptance, something that will give meaning to their lives. Bill tries to find it through good will in the community. Johnny finds it in the Nightriders, a local gang. David Diggs, the boy’s dispirited uncle, aspires to be an artist but has to settle for sign painting. David and Johnny’s new friendship with Bill kindles hope that their lives will get better. David’s marriage has failed; his wife’s shallow faith serves as her outlet from racial and financial oppression. David’s unhappy routine is broken by Edith Johnson’s return to Beetlecreek, but this relationship will be no better than his loveless marriage. Bill’s attempts to unify black and white children with a community picnic is a disaster. A rumor scapegoats him as a child molester, and Beetlecreek is titillated by the imagined crimes.This novel portraying race relations in a remote West Virginia town has been termed an existential classic. “It would be hard,” said The New Yorker , “to give Mr. Demby too much praise for the skill with which he has maneuvered the relationships in this book.” During the 1960s Arna Bontemps wrote, “Demby’s troubled townsfolk of the West Virginia mining region foreshadow present dilemmas. The pressing and resisting social forces in this season of our discontent and the fatal paralysis of those of us unable or unwilling to act are clearly anticipated with the dependable second sight of a true artist.”First published in 1950, Beetlecreek stands as a moving condemnation of provincialism and fundamentalism. Both a critique of racial hypocrisy and a new direction for the African American novel, it occupies fresh territory that is neither the ghetto realism of Richard Wright nor the ironic modernism of Ralph Ellison. Even after fifty years, more or less, William Demby said in 1998, “It still seems to me that Beetlecreek is about the absence of symmetry in human affairs, the imperfectability of justice the tragic inevitability of mankind’s inhumanity to mankind.”","['Fiction', 'African American', 'American Fiction']"

Irisches Tagebuch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/943365.Irisches_Tagebuch,"Als die ""schönste Liebeserklärung an ein Land"" wird das ""Irische Tagebuch"" von Heinrich Böll (1917-1985) oft bezeichnet. Das ist es in der Tat - und ist doch weit mehr. Anders als der Verliebte, dessen Blick sich nur auf Farbenfrohes, Sonnenbeschienenes richtet und Dunkel nicht wahrnimmt, braucht Böll den Schatten, der Konturen erst erscheinen lässt. Mosaikartig setzt Böll Beobachtetes und Erlebtes erzählend zu einem Bild zusammen, in dem die Grundfarbe Grau durch mannigfaltige Abstufungen farbenfroh wirkt und den Betrachter Helligkeit umso intensiver empfinden läßt. Irland, abseits von Wirtschaftswunder und Business-Zivilisation, übergangen vom Tourismus, ein Land, wo die Straßen noch den Kühen und Schulkindern gehören, wo harte Arbeit und Armut keinen Widerspruch bilden und drei von acht Kindern später ihren Lebensunterhalt als Emigranten im Ausland verdienen müssen, wo statt des täglichen Brotes nur der tägliche Regen sicher ist, wo Kirche und Wirtshaus gleichberechtigt zentrale Lebensfunktion haben und der Mensch Maßstab aller Dinge geblieben ist - diesem Irland hat Böll seine Impressionen gewidmet, hat Folkloristisches, Literarisches, Geschichtliches wie Soziales zu einem feinsinnigen Portrait zusammengefügt. Wer schon in Irland war, bei dem löst das ""Irische Tagebuch"" Wehmut, vielleicht sogar Heimweh aus. Wer noch nicht auf der ""Insel der Heiligen"" war, der wird Sehnsucht nach einem Land empfinden, das er fast schon zu kennen meint.","['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'German Literature', 'Ireland', 'Classics', 'Germany', 'Literature', 'Memoir', 'Irish Literature', 'Biography']"

The first book in Bruce Catton’s Pulitzer Prize–winning Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Mr. Lincoln’s Army is a riveting history of the early years of the Civil War, when a fledgling Union Army took its stumbling first steps under the command of the controversial general George McClellan. Following the secession of the Southern states, a beleaguered President Abraham Lincoln entrusted the dashing, charismatic McClellan with the creation of the Union’s Army of the Potomac and the responsibility of leading it to a swift and decisive victory against Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Although a brilliant tactician who was beloved by his troops and embraced by the hero-hungry North, McClellan’s ego and ambition ultimately put him at loggerheads with his commander in chief—a man McClellan considered unworthy of the presidency.   McClellan’s weaknesses were exposed during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American military history, which ended in a stalemate even though the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered. After Antietam, Lincoln ordered McClellan’s removal from command, and the Union entered the war’s next chapter having suffered thousands of casualties and with great uncertainty ahead.   America’s premier chronicler of the nation’s brutal internecine conflict, Bruce Catton is renowned for his unparalleled ability to bring a detailed and vivid immediacy to Civil War battlefields and military strategy sessions. With tremendous depth and insight, he presents legendary commanders and common soldiers in all their complex and heartbreaking humanity.","['History', 'Civil War', 'Nonfiction', 'American Civil War', 'American History', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'American', '19th Century']"

A profound revelation born out of his years as a prisoner in Auschwitz & other concentration camps, logotherapy is a modern & positive approach to the mentally or spiritually disturbed personality. Stressing the freedom to transcend suffering & find a meaning to life regardless of circumstances, it's a theory which, since its conception, has exercised a tremendous influence upon the entire field of psychiatry & psychology.Here, Frankl not only describes the genesis & development of logotherapy but also explains its basic concepts, & in this revised enlarged edition, has included a new chapter, entitled ""The Case for a Tragic Optimism,"" in which he updates theoretical conclusions of the book.

The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15012.The_Haunted_Screen,"The Golden Age of German cinema began at the end of the First World War and ended shortly after the coming of sound. From The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari onwards the principal films of this period were characterized by two influences: literary Expressionism, and the innovations of the theatre directors of this period, in particular Max Reinhardt. This book demonstrates the connection between German Romanticism and the cinema through Expressionist writings. It discusses the influence of the theatre: the handling of crowds; the use of different levels, and of selective lighting on a predominately dark stage; the reliance on formalized gesture; the innovation of the intimate theatre. Against this background the principal films of the period are examined in detail. The author explains the key critical concepts of the time, and surveys not only the work of the great directors, such as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, but also the contribution of their writers, cameramen, and designers. As wrote, 'Mme. Eisner is first and foremost a film critic, and one of the best in the world. She has all the necessary gifts.' And it described the original French edition of this book as 'one of the very few classics of writing on the film and arguably the best book on the cinema yet written.'","['Film', 'Nonfiction', 'Art', 'Media Tie In', 'History', 'Germany', 'Horror', 'Theory', 'German Literature']"

Politics Among Nations,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116876.Politics_Among_Nations,"Hans Morgenthau's classic text established realism as the fundamental way of thinking about international relations. Although it has had its critics, the fact that it continues to be the most long lived text for courses in international relations attests to its enduring value. Someone has said the study of international relations has for half a century been nothing so much as a dialogue between Morgenthau, those who embrace his approach, and those who turn elsewhere for enlightenment. After 50 years, the dialogue between Morgenthau and scholars from around the world continues more or less as in the past something with more intensity even in an ""age of terror."" The new edition preserves intact Morgenthau's original work while adding a 40 page introduction by the editors who explore its relevance for a new era. What follows the introduction are the perspectives of a dozen statesmen, scholars, and observers each offering insights on Morgenthau's concepts and ideas as they relate to current crises on every continent.

Critique and Crises: Enlightenment and the Pathogenesis of Modern Society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/329805.Critique_and_Crises,"Critique and Crisis established Reinhart Koselleck's reputation as the most important German intellectual historian of the postwar period. This first English translation of Koselleck's tour de force demonstrates a chronological breadth, a philosophical depth, and an originality which are hardly equalled in any scholarly domain. It is a history of the Enlightenment in miniature, fundamental to our understanding of that period and its consequences. Like Tocqueville, Koselleck views Enlightenment intellectuals as an uprooted, unrealistic group of onlookers who sowed the seeds of the modern political tensions that first flowered in the French Revolution. He argues that it was the split that developed between state and society during the Enlightenment that fostered the emergence of this intellectual elite divorced from the realities of politics. Koselleck describes how this disjunction between political authority proper and its subjects led to private spheres that later became centers of moral authority and, eventually, models for political society that took little or no notice of the constraints under which politicians must inevitably work. In this way progressive bourgeois philosophy, which seemed to offer the promise of a unified and peaceful world, in fact produced just the opposite. The book provides a wealth of examples drawn from all of Europe to illustrate the still relevant message that we evade the constraints and the necessities of the political realm at our own risk. Critique and Crisis is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought, edited by Thomas McCarthy.","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'European History', 'Social Science', 'Theory']"
Writing Degree Zero,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/300818.Writing_Degree_Zero,"Is there any such thing as revolutionary literature? Can literature, in fact, be political at all? These are the questions Roland Barthes addresses in Writing Degree Zero, his first published book and a landmark in his oeuvre. The debate had engaged the European literary community since the 1930s; with this fierce manifesto, Barthes challenged the notion of literature's obligation to be socially committed. Yes, Barthes allows, the writer has a political and ethical responsibility. But the history of French literature shows that the writer has often failed to meet it—and from his perspective, literature is committed to little more than the myth of itself. Expert and uncompromising, introduced the themes that would soon establish Barthes as one of the leading voices in literary criticism.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'France', 'Literary Criticism', 'Writing', 'Criticism']"

In her study of the state of modern humanity, Hannah Arendt considers humankind from the perspective of the actions of which it is capable.

James Joyce,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164434.James_Joyce,"Although several biographers have thrown themselves into the breach since this magisterial book first appeared in 1959, none have come close to matching the late Richard Ellmann's achievement. To be fair, Ellmann does have some distinct advantages. For starters, there's his deep mastery of the Irish milieu--demonstrated not only in this volume but in his books on Yeats and Wilde. He's also an admirable stylist himself--graceful, witty, and happily unintimidated by his brilliant subjects. But in addition, Ellmann seems to have an uncanny grasp on Joyce's personality: his reverence for the Irishman's literary accomplishment is always balanced by a kind of bemused affection for his faults. Whether Joyce is putting the finishing touches on Ulysses, falling down drunk in the streets of Trieste, or talking dirty to his future wife via the postal service, Ellmann's account always shows us a genius and a human being--a daunting enough task for a fiction writer, let alone the poor, fact-fettered biographer. Richard Ellmann has revised and expanded his definitive work on Joyce's life to include newly discovered primary material, including details of a failed love affair, a limerick about Samuel Beckett, a dream notebook, previously unknown letters, and much more.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Ireland', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Literature', 'Irish Literature', 'Literary Criticism', 'Criticism', '20th Century']"
The Worldly Philosophers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82120.The_Worldly_Philosophers,"The Worldly Philosophers not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas—namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.

On its journey seaward, it passes through countryside that has long been at the heart of the Japanese tradition. And it flows too past the mountains and the villages, past the dams, ditches and rice fields that provide such a richly textured backdrop to this novel.Powerful enough to sweep away people on its banks and placid enough to carry along with its flow a sumptuous wedding procession, The River Ki dominates the lives of the people who live in its fertile valley and imparts a vital strength to the three women, mother, daughter and granddaughter, around whom this novel is built. It provides them with the courage to cope, in their different ways, with the unprecedented changes that occurred in Japan between the last years of the last century and the middle of this century.Sawako Ariyoshi, one of Japan's most successful modern novelists, describes this social and cultural revolution largely through the eyes of Hana, a woman with the vision and integrity to understand the inevitability of the death of the traditional order in Japan. Ariyoshi writes with a love for detail bound to a broader understanding of the importance of the geographical and biological forces that mold her characters-and the result is a story that flows with all the vitality of The River Ki itself.","['Japan', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'Roman', 'Feminism', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']"

In The King's Two Bodies, Kantorowicz traces the historical problem posed by the ""King's two bodies""--the body politic and the body natural--back to the Middle Ages and demonstrates, by placing the concept in its proper setting of medieval thought and political theory, how the early-modern Western monarchies gradually began to develop a ""political theology.?The king's natural body has physical attributes, suffers, and dies, naturally, as do all humans; but the king's other body, the spiritual body, transcends the earthly and serves as a symbol of his office as majesty with the divine right to rule. The notion of the two bodies allowed for the continuity of monarchy even when the monarch died, as summed up in the formulation ""The king is dead. Long live the king.""Bringing together liturgical works, images, and polemical material, explores the long Christian past behind this ""political theology."" It provides a subtle history of how commonwealths developed symbolic means for establishing their sovereignty and, with such means, began to establish early forms of the nation-state.Kantorowicz fled Nazi Germany in 1938, after refusing to sign a Nazi loyalty oath, and settled in the United States. While teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, he once again refused to sign an oath of allegiance, this one designed to identify Communist Party sympathizers. He was dismissed as a result of the controversy and moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his life, and where he wrote .","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Medieval', 'Medieval History', 'Theology', 'European History', 'Academic', 'Christianity']"

In 1842, Tom Benton gallopes in the Red River Valley, one jump ahead of a Texas posse bent on hanging him. He feared no living thing. He loved danger and laughed at the impossible. He stole his wife from her husband, his land from its legal owner. Not content with lusty Sarah, he took a knife-slinging Cajun's daughter for a mistress. From the day Tom Benton arrived into Louisiana, he and her family ruled the bayou country.Tom sired three children. A daughter, Stormy, as wild and willful as himself. Wade, who inherited all of his father's weakness and none of his strength. And a second son not even Tom dared claim as his own -- a boy who one day would bring destruction and misery to the Benton clan. Devil's spawn they all were. Stormy ran away to the glittering life of a courtesan. Wade delivered his father over to the one man who could kill him. And in Benton's Row people watched, horrified, fascinated, and whispered -- “Every time a damned Benton is born, people should run for cover!”In 1920 his wife Sarah, aged ninety-seven, dies peacefully in her rocker on the veranda of Tom Benton’s sprawling plantation known as Broad Acres, nestled in the exotic and mysterious Louisiana river country.

"The Hunger, and Other Stories",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2007491.The_Hunger_and_Other_Stories,"When The Hunger and Other Stories (1957) appeared, it heralded the arrival of Charles Beaumont (1929-1967) as an important and highly original new voice in American fiction. Although he is best known today for his scripts for television and film, including several classic episodes of The Twilight Zone, Beaumont is being rediscovered as a master of weird tales, and this, his first published collection, contains some of his best. Ranging in tone from the chilling Gothic horror of ""Miss Gentilbelle,"" where an insane mother dresses her son up as a girl and slaughters his pets, to deliciously dark humor in tales like ""Open House"" and ""The Infernal Bouillabaisse,"" where murderers' plans go disastrously awry, these seventeen stories demonstrate Beaumont's remarkable talent and versatility. This new edition of The Hunger and Other Stories, the first in more than fifty years, includes a new introduction by Dr. Bernice M. Murphy, who argues for reevaluation of Beaumont alongside the other greats of the genre, including Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, and Richard Matheson.Contents:Miss Gentilbelle • (1957)The Vanishing American • (1955)A Point of Honor • (1955)Fair Lady • (1957)Free Dirt • (1955)Open House • (1957)The Train • (1957)The Dark Music • (1956)The Customers • (1957)Last Night in the Rain • (1956)The Crooked Man • (1955)Nursery Rhyme • (1957)The Murderers • (1955)The Hunger • (1955)Tears of the Madonna • (1957)The Infernal Bouillabaisse • (1957)Black Country • (1954)","['Horror', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Weird Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Collections', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Literary Fiction']"

And from the moment he saw those great forbidding walls, and realized fully that within them his father was buried alive, Paul Mathry became a man possessed.If his father was guilty, why had he not been hanged? Was it possible that for fifteen years an innocent man had endured unspeakable degradation and mental torture?Paul plunged into the past, immersed himself in the facts of the trial and the lives of the witnesses. The closer he came to the truth, the more he was threatened and pressured from high places. The name Mathry had made him a marked man--and he suffered.At their own risk a few people befriended him, offered him help. One, above all, believed in him--Lena Andersen--grave, lovely Lena, whose own ordeal reassured him, whose unspoken love sustained him in his long, hectic, agonizing drive for justice and his father's freedom.The impact of Beyond This Place is tremendous and readers will remember it vividly--and with pleasure--for a long time.(from inside jacket flap)","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literature']"

Originally published in 1958, The Idea of a Social Science and Its Relation to Philosophy was a landmark exploration of the social sciences, written at a time when that field was still young and had not yet joined the Humanities and the Natural Sciences as the third great domain of the Academy.A passionate defender of the importance of philosophy to a full understanding of 'society' against those who would deem it an irrelevant 'ivory towers' pursuit, Winch draws from the works of such thinkers as Ludwig Wittgenstein, J.S. Mill and Max Weber to make his case.

Τα Φάσματα ή Η Χαρά Στον Άλλο Δρόμο,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8433348,"Sachtouris beckons us to touch his traumas and wounds and to ponder on his future. Nevertheless, he forbids us to think of ways to cure him or to ungracefully or extortionately explain his plights, since he believes that this matter does not fall under his competency. Showing us the symptoms ought to be enough – anything beyond that would be sheer prolixity.What is paramount is the image. Its excellence is unquestionable in the sense of it being not just a structural unit but a prolonged, independent vector of meaning, which directly draws its origins from expressionistic theory and practice.The use of images ought to go beyond the dry recording of external reality. Images acquire autonomous power, thus they become unfettered from the limiting nature of the mirror; thanks to the symbolic nuances that images are imbued with by the author, they create an inner landscape that, although still reflecting experiences and feelings of every day life, is light years away from the realism of social decadence or from the lyrical style of a personal confession. The odd and excessive elements that we can discern in the expressionistic images stand for the fixed – albeit invisible to the naked eye – characteristics of a world that suffers to its very core.Sachtouris’ images develop into self-reliant, symbolic units that go beyond isolated episodes and casuistry in general, so as to create a dissonant introverted universe, in which objects, animals, humans and machines are gradually degraded to substitutes of reality, without however shedding their commonly accepted qualities.",[]

But when he pushed aside the tommy-gun of a Russian sentry in Berlin he became the focal point of publicity and of the attentions of Dottie Peale. Muriel did not know Dottie and the General soon found himself in fields of action for which he had not been trained.John Marquand has brought a great sympathetic understanding to this highly trained leader in war who had become isolated from the sophisticated world outside the army. Dottie was noticeably attractive in any society and in the freedom of wartime Paris she represented for Mel Goodwin a break in the monotony of high echelon routine. That taste of excitement was not forgotten amidst his much publicized return to New York and Muriel's ambitious planning. Dottie understood Mel's need and was heedlessly eager to satisfy it. And Muriel knew that her husband was a general who could only belong to her by remaining a general.The conflict between these two women and the General's struggle with himself as he searches for a normal life despite his lifetime special training makes the most dramatic novel Mr. Marquand has written. The activities of the Pentagon, the excitement of New York, the liberties of Paris, the crisis of battle, the life in foreign stations and the quiet of small-town New England are all part of the General's career and responsibility.",[]

Nearly twenty years later, when published for the first time in English, Discourse on Colonialism inspired a new generation engaged in the Civil Rights, Black Power, and antiwar movements.Aimé Césaire eloquently describes the brutal impact of capitalism and colonialism on both the colonizer and colonized, exposing the contradictions and hypocrisy implicit in western notions of ""progress"" and ""civilization"" upon encountering the ""savage,"" ""uncultured,"" or ""primitive."" He reaffirms African values, identity, and culture, and their relevance, reminding us that ""the relationship between consciousness and reality is extremely complex. . . . It is equally necessary to decolonize our minds, our inner life, at the same time that we decolonize society.""An interview with Aimé Césaire by the poet René Depestre is also included.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Race', 'Essays', 'Africa', 'Post Colonial', 'Sociology']"

Moses,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/628994.Moses,"Moses brought a testament of faith, a love of justice & a hatred of tyranny to the world. His story has inspired movements of national liberation. Asch portrays him with vigor, insight & sympathy as a leader who struggled with implacable enemies, rebellious followers & personal failings to bring his people to a land of promise. Asch weaves a tapestry of superbly realized oriental color & movement. Egypt comes alive under his pen. The opulence & intrigue of Pharoah's court is contrasted with the poverty & oppression of the slaves who worked to build & maintain the empire. Every episode provides & an excitingly instructive example. We meet Moses as a young prince, rebelling under palace discipline, aware of rumors concerning his birth, drawn to the Hebrews, but afraid to reach out to them. We see him struggling with halting speech & a violent temper. Finally, he finds his true family & makes the decision to cast his lot with Israel. One day in the desert, God speaks to him out of a bush that burns but isn't consumed & commands him to deliver Israel to freedom. A great trek begins. This work of historical exactitude & sustained inspiration meets the challenge of Moses with a scope & authority worthy of that sublime figure.""In 1936, the novelist & critic Ludwig Lewisohn was asked to name the world’s ten greatest living Jews. The resulting list, which ran in The NY Times, included Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Martin Buber & Louis Brandeis.

He has had a profound impact on civil rights, anticolonialism, and black consciousness movements around the world. A Dying Colonialism is Fanon's incisive and illuminating account of how, during the Algerian Revolution, the people of Algeria changed centuries-old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as ""primitive,"" in order to destroy those oppressors. Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression. This is a strong, lucid, and militant book; to read it is to understand why Fanon says that for the colonized, ""having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death.""","['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Africa', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Algeria']"

Forget minor hazards like nuclear bombs. The discovery of time travel means that everything we know, anyone we know, might not only vanish, but never even have existed. Against that possibility stand the men and women of the Time Patrol, dedicated to preserving the history they know and protecting the future from fanatics, terrorists, and would-be dictators who would remold the shape of reality to suit their own purposes. But Manse Everard, the Patrol's finest temporal trouble-shooter, bears a heavy burden. The fabric of history is stained with human blood and suffering which he cannot, must not do anything to alleviate, lest his tampering bring disastrous alterations in future time. Everard must leave the horrors of the past in place, lest his tampering or that of the Patrol's opponents, the Exaltationists, erase all hope of a better future, and instead bring about a future filled with greater horrors than any recorded by past history at its darkest and most foul.Contents:* Time Patrol [Time Patrol • 1] (1955) / novelette by Poul Anderson: In the mid-20th century Manse Everard answers a job ad and gets hired as a time cop. Time travel will be invented centuries in the future; untold centuries beyond that mankind has evolved into a species called the Danellians, who persuaded the early time travellers to set up the Time Patrol with the aim of protecting all of time from any alteration by interfering temponauts that might risk the Danellians' existence. Manse's first mission is to go back to the late 19th century to correct the circumstances that led to the appearance of an anachronistic item in an old burial mound* Brave to Be a King [Time Patrol • 2] (1959) •/ novelette by Poul Anderson: A Time Patrol friend of Manse's, Keith, has gone missing in 6th-century Iran, and Keith's wife begs Manse to go find him. Trouble is, Manse has always had the serious hots for the wife, despite her somewhat whiny voice, so it's very tempting not to try very hard -- to assume that Keith has landed on his feet and is happy where he is, sort of thing. But his honourable self knows better. He discovers Keith has been forced to adopt the persona of Cyrus the Great; rescuing him while preserving the course of history proves to be a far more tortuous business than one might imagine.* Gibraltar Falls [Time Patrol • 3] (1975) / short story by Poul Anderson: What must have been the most remarkable spectacle of known prehistory, the collapse of the isthmus at the Gates of Hercules and the inundation of the basin that is now the Mediterranean Sea by the waters of the Atlantic* The Only Game in Town [Time Patrol • 4] (1960)/ novelette by Poul Anderson: Manse and a friend manage to head off the Chinese colonization, pre-Columbus, of the Americas.8 Delenda Est [Time Patrol • 5] (1955) / novelette by Poul Anderson: Manse and a friend return from a holiday in the Pleistocene to their own time, only to discover it considerably changed; clearly there's been an unauthorized change to history. Eventually they trace it to an incident during the Punic Wars, which incident made it possible for Hannibal to defeat Rome. They succeed in reversing the change, but know that in so doing they're wiping out all the people they've befriended in the alternative 1950s. They succeed, though, in saving the laughing-eyed Hoirish colleen whom Manse's friend has fallen for.* Ivory, and Apes, and Peacocks [Time Patrol • 6] (1983) / novella by Poul Anderson: Tells of the Exaltationists, the 23rd-century cult whose obsessive pursuit of hedonism renders them unimpressed by the effects their vicious power-and pleasure-seeking could do to the timestream, including the possibility of their wiping the existence of their own culture out of history. Pummairam, a youth who takes Manse under his wing when first the patrolman arrives in Tyre, engineers much of the tricksterism Manse must use to thwart the baddies.* The Sorrow of Odin the Goth [Time Patrol • 7] (1983) / novella by Poul Anderson: A history prof, Carl Farness, has allowed himself to become the personification of the god Odin to a 4th-century tribe of Goths; he has also allowed himself to become far too personally involved with the people whom he's there to study, marrying one of them (with the knowledge of his 20th-century wife) and keeping an eye on the usually somewhat messy fates of his children, grandchildren, etc. Manse gets involved because incarnations of gods are the kind of thing that cause history to be altered; in fact, as Carl points out, all kinds of Goth tribes were convinced they'd been visited by various deities, and their stories were usually quickly dismissed as myths, then forgotten. Still, he must extract himself from the situation with care.* Star of the Sea [Time Patrol • 8] (1991) / novella by Poul Anderson: Europe in the 1st century, and various peoples, led by the likes of Civilis, are rebelling against corrupt Roman rule -- with the violence continuing even after it becomes clear that an honourable peace could be struck. A major factor keeping them at war is the zeal of a visionary/prophetess called Veleda, who for reasons unknown has had a far greater and longer influence in a revealed timeline than she had in the known history of the period. Manse and a historian called Floris, who becomes his first real love, manage to sort out the situation.* The Year of the Ransom [Time Patrol • 9] (1988) / novel by Poul Anderson: Heroine Wanda Tamberley's Uncle Steve, living among Pizarro's brutal conquistadors at the time of the ransoming of Atahuallpa, is attacked by the Exaltationists and then abducted into a very distant past by a quick-witted Spanish soldier who believes him to be a demon. Manse and Wanda to the rescue, of course.* Death and the Knight [Time Patrol] (1995) / novelette by Poul Anderson: how to rescue an errant time agent without changing history. Hugues Marot, a time traveler from the future who towers over most men with his great height, is a member of the Templars. He has accurately predicted some future events: when he is arrested and detained by his fellow Templars, he grasps a crucifix which is a ""...symbol and source of help from beyond this world"".

Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/691002.Krapp_s_Last_Tape_and_Other_Dramatic_Pieces,"s/t: All That Fall; Embers; Acts Without Words, I and II; Mimes This collection of Nobel Prize winner Samuel Beckett’s dramatic pieces includes a short stage play, two radio plays, and two pantomimes. The stage play Krapp’s Last Tape evolves a shattering drama out of a monologue of a man who, at age sixty-nine, plays back the autobiographical tape he recorded on his thirty-ninth birthday.The two radio plays were commissioned by the BBC; All That Fall “plumbs the same pessimistic depths [as Waiting for Godot] in what seems a no less despairing search for human dignity” (London ), and is equally unforgettable theater, born of the ramblings of an old man and his wife. Finally, in the two pantomimes, Beckett takes drama to the point of pure abstraction with his portrayals of, in , frustrated desired, and in , corresponding motions of living juxtaposed in the slow despair of one man and the senselessly busy motion of another.","['Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Irish Literature', 'Theatre', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Ireland', '20th Century', 'Read For School']"

In Arden's introductory note to the text, he describes it as ""a realistic, but not a naturalistic"" play.The work follows three privates in the British Army and their sergeant, all of whom are deserters from a foreign imperialist war. Serjeant Musgrave and his men, Hurst, Sparky and Attercliffe, come to a northern English coal mining town in 1879. The community is in the grip of a coal strike and cut off by winter snow. The one means of reaching the town is by canal barge. They arrive in the company of the Bargee, a foul-mouthed, disrespectful individual who teases and abuses everyone, especially those in authority. In the local inn the soldiers meet Mrs. Hitchcock, who runs the inn, and the barmaid Annie. The soldiers are greeted by the mayor, parson and constable, who ask them to recruit men in hopes of alleviating some of the town's unemployment as a way to rid the town of their economic dead weight. Musgrave pretends that this is indeed his goal, and asks Mrs. Hitchcock about Billy Hicks, a dead fellow soldier from the mining town. It is revealed that Billy was the father of Annie's illegitimate child, but the baby died, and Annie's sanity has suffered from the loss of both Billy and her child.","['Plays', 'Drama', '20th Century', 'Fiction']"

Nameless, indefinable . . . one thing is certain: it's a killer, and likes to torture before it kills. Leslie Waller wrote such memorable novels as Dog Day Afternoon and Hide in Plain Sight.

Then they asked him his name, age and marital status. Yes, that seemed normal enough---but what was this talk about ""death trauma""?Thus was Thomas Blaine introduced to the year 2110, where science had discovered the technique of transferring a man's consciousness from one body to another. Where a man's mind could be snatched from the past, when his body was at the point of death, and brought forward into a ""host body"" in this fantastic future world.But that was only a small part of it. For the future had proved the reality of life after death, and discovered worlds beyond or simultaneous with our own---worlds where, through scientific techniques, a man could live again, in another body, when he died here. And in the process, the reality of ghosts, poltergeists, and zombies was also established.What did it all mean? How had this discovery of what they called the ""hereafter"" shaped the world of 2110?Thomas Blaine found himself living in a future where the discoveries and techniques imagined by people of his time, while having come about, were completely overwhelmed by discoveries no one had ever dreamed of.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Dystopia', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Classics']"

Does It Matter?,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60561.Does_It_Matter_,"This is a series of essays representing philosopher Alan Watts's most recent thinking on the astonishing problems of man's relations to his material environment. The basic theme is that civilized man confuses symbol with reality, his ways of describing and measuring the world with the world itself, and thus puts himself into the absurd situation of preferring money to wealth and eating the menu instead of the dinner.Thus, with his attention locked upon numbers and concepts, man is increasingly unconscious of nature and of his total dependence upon air, water, plants, animals, insects, and bacteria. He has been hallucinated into the notion that the so-called ""external"" world is a cluster of ""objects"" separate from himself, that he ""encounters"" it, that he comes into it instead of out of it. Consequently, our species is fouling its own nest and is in imminent danger of self-obliteration.Here, a philosopher whose works have been mainly concerned with mysticism and Oriental philosophy gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" problems of economics, technology, clothing, cooking, and housing.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Psychology', 'Essays', 'Buddhism', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Zen', 'Eastern Philosophy']"

Stevens proves himself as eloquent and scintillating in prose as in poetry, as he both analyzes and demonstrates the essential act of repossessing reality through the imagination.","['Poetry', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Criticism', 'Writing', 'Literature', 'Literary Criticism', 'Classics', '20th Century']"

The Opium of the Intellectuals,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166566.The_Opium_of_the_Intellectuals,"Raymond Aron's 1955 masterpiece The Opium of the Intellectuals, is one of the great works of twentieth- century political reflection. Aron shows how noble ideas can slide into the tyranny of ""secular religion"" and emphasizes how political thought has the profound responsibility of telling the truth about social and political reality-in all its mundane imperfections and tragic complexities.Aron explodes the three ""myths"" of radical thought: the Left, the Revolution, and the Proletariat. Each of these ideas, Aron shows, are ideological, mystifying rather than illuminating. He also provides a fascinating sociology of intellectual life and a powerful critique of historical determinism in the classically restrained prose for which he is justly famous.For this new edition, prepared by Daniel J. Mahoney and Brian C. Anderson as part of Transaction's ongoing ""Aron Project,"" political scientist Harvey Mansfield provides a luminous introduction that underscores the permanent relevance of Aron's work. The new edition also includes as an appendix ""Fanaticism, Prudence, and Faith,"" a remarkable essay that Aron wrote to defend Opium from its critics and to explain further his view of the proper role of political thinking. The book will be of interest to all students of political theory, history, and sociology.","['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'France', 'Economics']"

Written With My Left Hand,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22606741-written-with-my-left-hand,"Perhaps best known for two much-admired tales, the evocative ghost story 'Whessoe' and the grimly humorous horror tour-de-force 'Curious Adventure of Mr Bond', Nugent Barker (1888-1955) remains something of an enigma. Although rated highly by contemporaries: the 1929 edition of Edward J. O’Brien’s anthology The Best British Stories is dedicated to Barker: little is known of his life, and these twenty-one tales, first collected in 1950, are thought to represent the sum total of Barker’s literary output.As Douglas Anderson notes in his Foreword, Barker ranks alongside fellow twentieth-century exponents of the strange story, Walter de la Mare and John Metcalfe. But what makes Barker unique as a writer is the originality and diversity of his imagination.The stories collected here range widely, from the Poe-esque Parisian sophistication of ‘The Strange Disappearance of Monsieur Charbo’, to the sly and strangely touching Sussex folk-wisdom of ‘Stanley Hutchinson’; from the dislocated, dreamlike horror of ‘One, Two, Buckle My Shoe’ to the idyllic, time-travelling nostalgia of ‘The Thorn’.These powerfully-written stories, long out of print, deserve to be much better known. They will be relished by all those who appreciate the very best classic supernatural literature.",['Horror']
