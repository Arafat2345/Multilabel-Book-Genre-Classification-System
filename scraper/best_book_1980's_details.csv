The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']"

The Complete Maus,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15195.The_Complete_Maus,"On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as “the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust” (Wall Street Journal) and “the first masterpiece in comic book history” (The New Yorker).The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler’s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father’s story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.","['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'War', 'Holocaust', 'Classics']"

Cathedral,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11449.Cathedral,"Raymond Carver’s third collection of stories, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, including the canonical titular story about blindness and learning to enter the very different world of another.It was morning in America when Raymond Carver's Cathedral came out in 1983, but the characters in this dry collection of short stories from the forgotten corners of land of opportunity didn't receive much sunlight. Nothing much happens to the subjects of Carver's fiction, which is precisely why they are so harrowing: nothingness is a daunting presence to overcome. And rarely do they prevail, but the loneliness and quiet struggle the characters endure provide fertile ground for literary triumph, particularly in the hands of Carver, who was perhaps in his best form with this effort.(1938-1988) was an author who rejected the more experimental fiction of the 60s and 70s. He pioneered a precisionist realism reinventing the American short story during the eighties, heading the line of so-called ""dirty realists"" or ""K-mart realists"". They are stories of banal lives that turn on a seemingly insignificant detail. Carver writes with meticulous economy, suddenly bringing a life into focus in a similar way to the paintings of Edward Hopper.

Among the audience--pilgrims in a blind swoon of adoration--are hundreds of vampires, creatures who see Lestat as a ""greedy fiend risking the secret prosperity of all his kind just to be loved and seen by mortals,"" fiends themselves who hate Lestat's power and who are determined to destroy him . . .- The sleep of certain men and women--vampires mortals scattered around the world--is haunted by a vivid, mysterious dream: of twins with fiery red hair and piercing green eyes who suffer an unspeakable tragedy.  It is a dream that slowly, tauntingly reveals its meaning to the dreamers as they make their way toward each other--some to be destroyed on the journey, some to face an even more terrifying fate at journey's end . . .- Akasha--Queen of the Damned, mother of all vampires, rises after a 6,000 year sleep and puts into motion a heinous plan to ""save"" mankind from itself and make ""all myths of the world real"" by elevating herself and her chosen son/lover to the level of the gods: ""I am the fulfillment and I shall from this moment be the cause"" . . .These narrative threads wind sinuously across a vast, richly detailed tapestry of the violent, sensual world of vampirism, taking us back 6,000 years to its beginnings.  As the stories of the ""first brood"" of blood drinkers are revealed, we are swept across the ages, from Egypt to South America to the Himalayas to all the shrouded corners of the globe where vampires have left their mark.

Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.","['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Vampires', 'Fiction', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Gothic', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']"

Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35100.Battle_Cry_of_Freedom,"Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War.James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory.The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom,"" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict.This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Civil War', 'American History', 'War', 'American Civil War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Politics', 'Historical']"

If that question doesn't spark a dozen more questions in your mind (like ""What do you mean by 'smart,'"" ""How do I measure it"" and ""Who's asking?""), then The Mismeasure of Man, Stephen Jay Gould's masterful demolition of the IQ industry, should be required reading. Gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable? Why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some ""inferior"" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful. The revised edition includes a scathing critique of Herrnstein and Murray's , taking them to task for rehashing old arguments to exploit a new political wave of uncaring belt tightening.

In answering these questions, Shilts weaves the disparate threads into a coherent story, pinning down every evasion and contradiction at the highest levels of the medical, political, and media establishments.Shilts shows that the epidemic spread wildly because the federal government put budget ahead of the nation's welfare; health authorities placed political expediency before the public health; and scientists were often more concerned with international prestige than saving lives. Against this backdrop, Shilts tells the heroic stories of individuals in science and politics, public health and the gay community, who struggled to alert the nation to the enormity of the danger it faced. is both a tribute to these heroic people and a stinging indictment of the institutions that failed the nation so badly.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Science', 'LGBT', 'Medicine', 'Queer', 'Medical', 'Health', 'Sociology']"

While many studies have been written on nationalist political movements, the sense of nationality--the personal and cultural feeling of belonging to a nation--has not received proportionate attention. In this widely acclaimed work, Benedict Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the 'imagined communities' of nationality.Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.This revised edition includes two new chapters, one of which discusses the complex role of the colonialist state's mindset in the develpment of Third World nationalism, while the other analyses the processes by which, all over the world, nations came to imagine themselves as old.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Theory', 'Political Science', 'Academic', 'Social Science']"

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People,"When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Management', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']"

The Songlines,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76844.The_Songlines,"In this extraordinary book, Bruce Chatwin has adapted a literary form common until the eighteenth century though rare in ours; a story of ideas in which two companions, traveling and talking together, explore the hopes and dreams that animate both them and the people they encounter. Set in almost uninhabitable regions of Central Australia, The Songlines asks and tries to answer these questions: Why is man the most restless, dissatisfied of animals? Why do wandering people conceive the world as perfect whereas sedentary ones always try to change it? Why have the great teachers—Christ or the Buddha—recommended the Road as the way. to salvation? Do we agree with Pascal that all man's troubles stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room?We do not often ask these questions today for we commonly assume that living in a house is normal and that the wandering life is aberrant. But for more than twenty years Chatwin has mulled over the possibility that the reverse might be the case.Pre-colonial Australia was the last landmass on earth peopled not by herdsmen, farmers, or city dwellers, but by hunter-gatherers. Their labyrinths of invisible pathways across the continent are known to us as Songlines or Dreaming Tracks, but to the Aboriginals as the tracks of their ancestors—the Way of the Law. Along these ""roads"" they travel in order to perform all those activities that are distinctively human—song, dance, marriage, exchange of ideas, and arrangements of territorial boundaries by agreement rather than force.In Chatwin's search for the Songlines, Arkady is an ideal friend and guide: Australian by birth, the son of a Cossack exile, with all the strength and warmth of his inheritance. Whether hunting kangaroo from a Land Cruiser, talking to the diminutive Rolf in his book-crammed trailer, buying drinks for a bigoted policeman (and would-be writer), cheering as Arkady's true love declares herself (part of is a romantic comedy), Chatwin turns this almost implausible picaresque adventure into something approaching the scale of a Greek tragedy.The life of the Aboriginals stands in vivid contrast, of course, to the prevailing cultures of our time. And presents unforgettable details about the kinds of disputes we know all too well from less traumatic confrontations: over sacred lands invaded by railroads, mines, and construction sites, over the laws and rights of a poor people versus a wealthy invasive one. To Chatwin these are but recent, local examples of an eternal basic distinction between settlers and wanderers. His book, devoted to the latter, is a brilliant evocation of this profound optimism: that man is by nature not a bellicose aggressor but a pacific, song-creating, adaptive species whose destiny is to quest for the truth.","['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Australia', 'History', 'Anthropology', 'Memoir', 'Adventure', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Literature']"

In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents.

Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32081.Albion_s_Seed,"This book is the first volume in a cultural history of the United States, from the earliest English settlements to our own time. It is a history of American folkways as they have changed through time, and it argues a thesis about the importance for the United States of having been British in its cultural origins.From 1629 to 1775, North America was settled by four great waves of English-speaking immigrants. The first was an exodus of Puritans from the east of England to Massachusetts (1629-1640). The second was the movement of a Royalist elite and indentured servants from the south of England to Virginia (ca. 1649-75). The third was the ""Friends' migration,""--the Quakers--from the North Midlands and Wales to the Delaware Valley (ca. 1675-1725). The fourth was a great flight from the borderlands of North Britain and northern Ireland to the American backcountry (ca. 1717-75).These four groups differed in many ways--in religion, rank, generation and place of origin. They brought to America different folkways which became the basis of regional cultures in the United States. They spoke distinctive English dialects and built their houses in diverse ways. They had different ideas of family, marriage and gender; different practices of child-naming and child-raising; different attitudes toward sex, age and death; different rituals of worship and magic; different forms of work and play; different customs of food and dress; different traditions of education and literacy; different modes of settlement and association. They also had profoundly different ideas of comity, order, power and freedom which derived from British folk-traditions. describes those differences in detail, and discusses the continuing importance of their transference to America.Today most people in the United States (more than 80 percent) have no British ancestors at all. These many other groups, even while preserving their own ethnic cultures, have also assimilated regional folkways which were transplanted from Britain to America. In that sense, nearly all Americans today are ""Albion's Seed,"" no matter what their ethnic origins may be; but they are so in their different regional ways.The concluding section of explores the ways that regional cultures have continued to dominate national politics from 1789 to 1988, and still control attitudes toward education, government, gender, and violence, on which differences between American regions are greater than between European nations.also argues that the four British folkways created an expansive cultural pluralism that has proved to the more libertarian than any single culture alone could be. Together they became the determinants of a voluntary society in the United States.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Politics', 'American', 'Sociology', 'Cultural', 'Anthropology', 'The United States Of America', 'British Literature']"

Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12617.Manufacturing_Consent,"In this pathbreaking work, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky show that, contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order.Based on a series of case studies—including the media’s dichotomous treatment of “worthy” versus “unworthy” victims, “legitimizing” and “meaningless” Third World elections, and devastating critiques of media coverage of the U.S. wars against Indochina—Herman and Chomsky draw on decades of criticism and research to propose a Propaganda Model to explain the media’s behavior and performance. Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications. These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media’s handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.","['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Economics', 'Journalism', 'Theory', 'Psychology', 'Political Science']"

That's why Lee Strobel - an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions - decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity's claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You'll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal. Like Strobel, you'll be amazed at the evidence - how much there is, how strong it is, and what it says. The facts are in. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?","['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Christian Living', 'History']"

In Gore Vidal's Lincoln we meet Lincoln the man and Lincoln the political animal, the president who entered a besieged capital where most of the population supported the South and where even those favoring the Union had serious doubts that the man from Illinois could save it. Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections. Brilliantly conceived, masterfully executed, Gore Vidal's Lincoln allows the man to breathe again.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Civil War', 'Historical', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Literature', 'Presidents', 'American', 'Novels']"

At the dealer's shop she interrupts a mysterious-sounding conversation. And then, even more alarmingly, the dealer attempts to refuse to sell her a scrap of papyrus Ramses discovers in the back room. When the dealer is found dead in his shop just a day later, Amelia becomes convinced that foul play is at hand, a suspicion that is further confirmed when she catches sight of the sinister stranger from the crime scene at her own excavation site.But it takes more than Amelia's keen instincts to convince Emerson of dastardly deeds. When Ramses's scrap of papyrus is stolen from their camp, and a neighboring tourist is relieved of an entire mummy, Emerson concedes that they may be facing something more ominous than a simple grave robber.

Oscar Wilde: A Biography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1056910.Oscar_Wilde,"In this long-awaited biography, Wilde the legendary Victorian - brilliant writer and conversationalist, reckless flouter of social and sexual conventions - is brought to life. More astute and forbearing, yet more fallible than legend has allowed, Wilde is given here the dimensions of a modern hero. Based on fresh material from many hitherto-untapped sources, Ellmann depicts Wilde's comet-like ascent on the Victorian scene and his equally dramatic sudden eclipse. His Irish background, the actresses to whom he paid court, his unfortunate wife and lovers, his clothes, coiffures, and the decor of his rooms - all are presented here in vivid detail. The saga of his 1882 American tour is recounted with a wealth of new details; also his later impact on the bastions of the French literary establishment. The London of the Nineties, of Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites, Lillie Langtry and the Prince of Wales, is evoked alongside Paris of the ""belle epoque"" and the Greece, Italy and North Africa of Wilde'stravels. Ellmann's definitive critical account of Wilde's entire oeuvre shows him as the proponent of a radical new aesthetic who was perilously at odds with Victorian society. After his period of success and daring, the fatal love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas is followed by exposure, imprisonment, a few wretched years abroad and death in exile. The tragic end of Wilde's life leaves the reader with a sense of compassion and grief for the protagonist.

Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5497.Akhenaten,"From the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and author of the Cairo trilogy, comes Akhenaten, a fascinating work of fiction about the most infamous pharaoh of ancient Egypt.In this beguiling new novel, originally published in 1985 and now appearing for the first time in the United States, Mahfouz tells with extraordinary insight the story of the ""heretic pharaoh,"" or ""sun king,""--and the first known monotheistic ruler--whose iconoclastic and controversial reign during the 18th Dynasty (1540-1307 B.C.) has uncanny resonance with modern sensibilities.Narrating the novel is a young man with a passion for the truth, who questions the pharaoh's contemporaries after his horrible death--including Akhenaten's closest friends, his most bitter enemies, and finally his enigmatic wife, Nefertiti--in an effort to discover what really happened in those strange, dark days at Akhenaten's court.  As our narrator and each of the subjects he interviews contribute their version of Akhenaten, ""the truth"" becomes increasingly evanescent.Akhenaten encompasses all of the contradictions his subjects see in him: at once cruel and empathic, feminine and barbaric, mad and divinely inspired, his character, as Mahfouz imagines him, is eerily modern, and fascinatingly ethereal.  An ambitious and exceptionally lucid and accessible book, is a work only Mahfouz could render so elegantly, so irresistibly.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Egypt', 'Novels', 'Africa', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Egyptian Literature']"

At the still center of the breakneck action--revealed in Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialoge--is Paul's wife, Liz, and over it all looms the shadowy figure of McCandless, a geologist from whom Paul and Liz rent their house. As Paul mishandles the situation, his wife takes the geologist to her bed and a fire and aborted assassination occur; Ude issues a call to arms as harrowing as any Jeremiad--and Armageddon comes rapidly closer. Displaying Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialogue, and his startling treatments of violence and sexuality, Carpenter's Gothic ""shows again that Gaddis is among the first rank of contemporary American writers"" (Malcolm Bradbury, ""The Washington Post Book World"" ).""An unholy landmark of a novel--an extra turret added on to the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion Gaddis has been building in American letters"" --Cynthia Ozick, ""The New York Times Book Review""""Everything in this compelling and brilliant vision of America--the packaged sleaze, the incipient violence, the fundamentalist furor, the constricted sexuality--is charged with the force of a volcanic eruption.

The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61538.The_Extended_Phenotype,"People commonly view evolution as a process of competition between individuals—known as “survival of the fittest”—with the individual representing the “unit of selection.” Richard Dawkins offers a controversial reinterpretation of that idea in The Extended Phenotype, now being reissued to coincide with the publication of the second edition of his highly-acclaimed The Selfish Gene. He proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. We can then view changes in phenotypes—the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual—as serving the evolutionary interests of genes.Dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one’s body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of “arms race” between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of DNA can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest.

Throughout, Bergman recounts his life in a series of deeply personal flashbacks that document some of the most important moments in twentieth-century filmmaking as well as the private obsessions of the man behind them.

Il retrace donc en détail les époques de sa vie, depuis l'Angleterre victorienne, le music-hall, la naissance et le déclin de Hollywood ou le cauchemar du maccarthysme, jusqu'aux dernières années écoulées paisiblement en Suisse, où il meurt le 25 décembre 1977.Il révèle certains faits méconnus et réajuste les avis, inévitablement subjectifs, que Chaplin avait exprimés dans son autobiographie à l'égard de ses amis, de ses proches ou de ses aventures amoureuses. Les notes de travail, les rapports de studios, les prises non utilisées viennent aussi dévoiler ce que Chaplin gardait secret : le processus de création de ses visions comiques.L'ascension formidable de ce petit Anglais, animé par une infatigable quête de perfection, s'explique à bien des égards par sa personnalité complexe et souvent contradictoire. Adulé par le public, malgré les chroniques scandaleuses qu'alimenta sa vie privée, il fut et reste incontestablement un génie et un des mythes fondateurs du XXe siècle.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Film', 'Media Tie In', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Comedy', 'Pop Culture', 'Art']"

The Many-Coloured Land,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378639.The_Many_Coloured_Land,"In the year 2034, Theo Guderian, a French physicist, made an amusing but impractical discovery: the means to use a one-way, fixed-focus time warp that opened into a place in the Rhone River valley during the idyllic Pliocene Epoch, six million years ago. But, as time went on, a certain usefulness developed. The misfits and mavericks of the future—many of them brilliant people—began to seek this exit door to a mysterious past. In 2110, a particularly strange and interesting group was preparing to make the journey—a starship captain, a girl athlete, a paleontologist, a woman priest, and others who had reason to flee the technological perfection of twenty-second-century life.Thus begins this dazzling fantasy novel that invites comparisons with the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ursula Le Quin. It opens up a whole world of wonder, not in far-flung galaxies but in our own distant past on Earth—a world that will captivate not only science-fiction and fantasy fans but also those who enjoy literate thrillers.The group that passes through the time-portal finds an unforeseen strangeness on the other side. Far from being uninhabited, Pliocene Europe is the home of two warring races from another planet. There is the knightly race of the Tanu—handsome, arrogant, and possessing vast powers of psychokinesis and telepathy. And there is the outcast race of Firvulag—dwarfish, malevolent, and gifted with their own supernormal skills. Taken captive by the Tanu and transported through the primordial European landscape, the humans manage to break free, join in an uneasy alliance with the forest-dwelling Firvulag, and, finally, launch an attack against the Tanu city of light on the banks of a river that, eons later, would be called the Rhine.Myth and legend, wit and violence, speculative science and breathtaking imagination mingle in this romantic fantasy, which is the first volume in a series about the exile world.","['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Fiction']"

The Old Devils,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366427.The_Old_Devils,"Age has done everything except mellow the characters in Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils, which turns its humane and ironic gaze on a group of Welsh married couples who have been spending their golden years—when “all of a sudden the evening starts starting after breakfast”—nattering, complaining, reminiscing, and, above all, drinking. This more or less orderly social world is thrown off-kilter, however, when two old friends unexpectedly return from England: Alun Weaver, now a celebrated man of Welsh letters, and his entrancing wife, Rhiannon. Long-dormant rivalries and romances are rudely awakened, as life at the Bible and Crown, the local pub, is changed irrevocably.Considered by Martin Amis to be Kingsley Amis’s greatest achievement—a book that “stands comparison with any English novel of the [twentieth] century”— confronts the attrition of ageing with rare candor, sympathy, and moral intelligence.","['Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Comedy', 'Contemporary']"

"The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175278.The_Glorious_Cause,"The first book to appear in the illustrious Oxford History of the United States, this critically acclaimed volume--a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize--offers an unsurpassed history of the Revolutionary War and the birth of the American republic.Beginning with the French and Indian War and continuing to the election of George Washington as first president, Robert Middlekauff offers a panoramic history of the conflict between England and America, highlighting the drama and anguish of the colonial struggle for independence. Combining the political and the personal, he provides a compelling account of the key events that precipitated the war, from the Stamp Act to the Tea Act, tracing the gradual gathering of American resistance that culminated in the Boston Tea Party and ""the shot heard 'round the world."" The heart of the book features a vivid description of the eight-year-long war, with gripping accounts of battles and campaigns, ranging from Bunker Hill and Washington's crossing of the Delaware to the brilliant victory at Hannah's Cowpens and the final triumph at Yorktown, paying particular attention to what made men fight in these bloody encounters. The book concludes with an insightful look at the making of the Constitution in the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 and the struggle over ratification. Through it all, Middlekauff gives the reader a vivid sense of how the colonists saw these events and the importance they gave to them. Common soldiers and great generals, Sons of Liberty and African slaves, town committee-men and representatives in congress--all receive their due. And there are particularly insightful portraits of such figures as Sam and John Adams, James Otis, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and many others.This new edition has been revised and expanded, with fresh coverage of topics such as mob reactions to British measures before the War, military medicine, women's role in the Revolution, American Indians, the different kinds of war fought by the Americans and the British, and the ratification of the Constitution.

Wartime: Understanding and Behaviour in the Second World War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154474.Wartime,"Winner of both the National Book Award for Arts and Letters and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory was one of the most original and gripping volumes ever written about the First World War. Frank Kermode, in The New York Times Book Review, hailed it as ""an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to make World War I part of our minds,"" and Lionel Trilling called it simply ""one of the most deeply moving books I have read in a long time."" In its panoramic scope and poetic intensity, it illuminated a war that changed a generation and revolutionized the way we see the world.Now, in Fussell turns to the Second World War, the conflict he himself fought in, to weave a narrative that is both more intensely personal and more wide-ranging. Whereas his former book focused primarily on literary figures, on the image of the Great War in literature, here Fussell examines the immediate impact of the war on common soldiers and civilians. He describes the psychological and emotional atmosphere of World War II. He analyzes the euphemisms people needed to deal with unacceptable reality (the early belief, for instance, that the war could be won by ""precision bombing,"" that is, by long distance); he describes the abnormally intense frustration of desire and some of the means by which desire was satisfied; and, most important, he emphasizes the damage the war did to intellect, discrimination, honesty, individuality, complexity, ambiguity and wit. Of course, no Fussell book would be complete without some serious discussion of the literature of the time. He examines, for instance, how the great privations of wartime (when oranges would be raffled off as valued prizes) resulted in rococo prose styles that dwelt longingly on lavish dinners, and how the ""high-mindedness"" of the era and the almost pathological need to ""accentuate the positive"" led to the downfall of the acerbic H.L. Mencken and the ascent of E.B. White. He also offers astute commentary on Edmund Wilson's argument with Archibald MacLeish, Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine, the war poetry of Randall Jarrell and Louis Simpson, and many other aspects of the wartime literary world.Fussell conveys the essence of that wartime as no other writer before him. For the past fifty years, the Allied War has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by ""the sentimental, the loony patriotic, the ignorant, and the bloodthirsty."" Americans, he says, have never understood what the Second World War was really like. In this stunning volume, he offers such an understanding.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'American History', 'European History']"
Assata: An Autobiography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100322.Assata,"On May 2, 1973, Black Panther Assata Shakur (aka JoAnne Chesimard) lay in a hospital, close to death, handcuffed to her bed, while local, state, and federal police attempted to question her about the shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike that had claimed the life of a white state trooper. Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand of government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside and the works of Maya Angelou.Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison. She was given political asylum by Cuba, where she now resides.","['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Race', 'Feminism', 'Politics', 'Autobiography', 'Social Justice', 'Biography Memoir']"

The Return of Martin Guerre,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1134047.The_Return_of_Martin_Guerre,"The Inventive Peasant Arnaud du Tilh had almost persuaded the learned judges at the Parlement of Toulouse, when on a summer's day in 1560 a man swaggered into the court on a wooden leg, denounced Arnaud & reestablished his claim to the identity, property & wife of Martin Guerre. The astonishing case captured the imagination of the Continent. Told & retold over the centuries, the story of Martin Guerre became a legend, still remembered in the Pyrenean village where the impostor was executed over 400 years ago. Now a noted historian, who served as consultant for a French film on Martin Guerre, has searched archives & lawbooks to add new dimensions to a tale already abundant in mysteries. We're led to ponder how a common man could become an impostor in the 16th century, why Bertrande de Rols, an honorable peasant woman, would accept such a man as her husband, & why lawyers, poets & men of letters like Montaigne became so fascinated with the episode. Natalie Zemon Davis reconstructs the lives of ordinary people, in a way that reveals the hidden attachments & sensibilities of nonliterate 16th-century villagers. Here we see people trying to fashion their identities within a world of traditional ideas about property & family & of changing ideas about religion. We learn what happens when common people get involved in the workings of the criminal courts in the ancien régime, & how judges struggle to decide who a man was in the days before fingerprints & photos. We sense the secret affinity between the eloquent men of law & the honey-tongued village impostor, a rare identification across class lines. Deftly written for both the public & specialists, The Return of Martin Guerre will interest those who want to know more about ordinary families & especially women of the past & about the creation of literary legends. It's also a remarkable psychological narrative about where self-fashioning stops & lying begins.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'School', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Microhistory', 'European History', 'Medieval', '16th Century']"

Tolkien, begun in 1916, when he was twenty-five years old, and left incomplete several years later. It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for the Lost Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend and association, they are set in the narrative frame of the great westward voyage of a mariner named Eriel (or AElfwine). His destination is Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle where Elves dwell; from them he learns their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. The Tales include the earliest accounts of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmography of their invented world. The Book of Lost Tales is published in two volumes. The first contains the Tales of Valinor; and this second past includes Beren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin. Each tale is followed by a commentary, together with associated poems, and each volume contains extensive information on names and vocabulary of the earliest Elvish languages.

He addresses the devastating effects of remote fathers and mourns the disappearance of male initiation rites in our culture. Finding rich meaning in ancient stories and legends, Bly uses the Grimm fairy tale ""Iron John,"" in which the narrator, or ""Wild Man,"" guides a young man through eight stages of male growth, to remind us of archetypes long forgotten-images of vigorous masculinity, both protective and emotionally centered.Simultaneously poetic and down-to-earth, combining the grandeur of myth with the practical and often painful lessons of our own histories, Iron John is a rare work that will continue to guide and inspire men-and women-for years to come.","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Mythology', 'Poetry', 'Spirituality', 'Gender', 'Sociology', 'Personal Development']"

And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state, so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time.","['Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'The United States Of America', '20th Century']"

Not Wanted on the Voyage,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1101625.Not_Wanted_on_the_Voyage,"Published in 1984, Not Wanted on the Voyage is one of Timothy Findley's most imaginative and compelling literary fictions. Findley turns to one of our essential myths: the biblical story of the great Flood, but he doesn't so much retell it as take our common knowledge of the Old Testament tale and give it an extraordinary twist. Here we have Dr. Noah Noyes, diabolical conjuror and dictatorial leader of his helpless little boat-bound band, sure of his total superiority as man, husband, and father, imposing his view of the ways of God on his wife and family.

Lucifer, who, having escaped from Hell, has decided to align himself with mankind). Findley, a great lover of cats, also gives us the crotchety Mottyl, making her way through her ninth and final life. is poetic and passionate and bursting with a wide-eyed inventiveness, at once a stunningly contemporary attempt at mythmaking, a grand novel of the power of the imagination, and a thoroughly good read.","['Fiction', 'Canada', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Canadian Literature', 'Magical Realism']"

Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58849.Lipstick_Traces,"Greil Marcus, author of Mystery Train, widely acclaimed as the best book ever written about America as seen through its music, began work on this new book out of a fascination with the Sex Pistols: that scandalous antimusical group, invented in London in 1975 and dead within two years, which sparked the emergence of the culture called punk. ""I am an antichrist!"" shouted singer Johnny Rotten--where in the world of pop music did that come from? Looking for an answer, with a high sense of the drama of the journey, Marcus takes us down the dark paths of counterhistory, a route of blasphemy, adventure, and surprise.This is no mere search for cultural antecedents. Instead, what Marcus so brilliantly shows is that various kinds of angry, absolute demands--demands on society, art, and all the governing structures of everyday life--seem to be coded in phrases, images, and actions passed on invisibly, but inevitably, by people quite unaware of each other. Marcus lets us hear strange yet familiar voices: of such heretics as the Brethren of the Free Spirit in medieval Europe and the Ranters in seventeenth-century England; the dadaists in Zurich in 1916 and Berlin in 1918, wearing death masks, chanting glossolalia; one Michel Mourre, who in 1950 took over Easter Mass at Notre-Dame to proclaim the death of God; the Lettrist International and the Situationist International, small groups of Paris--based artists and writers surrounding Guy Debord, who produced blank-screen films, prophetic graffiti, and perhaps the most provocative social criticism of the 1950s and '60s; the rioting students and workers of May '68, scrawling cryptic slogans on city walls and bringing France to a halt; the Sex Pistols in London, recording the savage ""Anarchy in the U.K."" and ""God Save the Queen.""Although the Sex Pistols shape the beginning and the end of the story, is not a book about music; it is about a common voice, discovered and transmitted in many forms. Working from scores of previously unexamined and untranslated essays, manifestos, and filmscripts, from old photographs, dada sound poetry, punk songs, collages, and classic texts from Marx to Henri Lefebvre, Marcus takes us deep behind the acknowledged events of our era, into a hidden tradition of moments that would seem imaginary except for the fact that they are real: a tradition of shared utopias, solitary refusals, impossible demands, and unexplained disappearances. Written with grace and force, humor and an insistent sense of tragedy and danger, tells a story as disruptive and compelling as the century itself.","['Music', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Art', 'Punk', 'Philosophy', 'Cultural', 'Cultural Studies', 'Criticism', 'Pop Culture']"

Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51378.Feminist_Theory,"A sweeping examination of the core issues of sexual politics, bell hooks' new book Feminist Theory: from margin to center argues that the contemporary feminist movement must establish a new direction for the 1980s. Continuing the debates surrounding her controversial first book, Ain't I A Woman, bell hooks suggests that feminists have not succeeded in creating a mass movement against sexist oppression because the very foundation of women's liberation has, until now, not accounted for the complexity and diversity of female experience. In order to fulfill its revolutionary potential, feminist theory must begin by consciously transforming its own definition to encompass the lives and ideas of women on the margin. Hooks' work is a challenge to the women's movement and will have profound impact on all whose lives have been touched by feminism and its insights.","['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Gender', 'Theory', 'Race', 'Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Feminist Theory', 'Gender Studies']"

Lancaster became deeply enamored of his children's governess, Catherine Swynford, but even this emotion could not stop his craving for the crown.When Wat Tyler's daughter was insulted by a tax collector, Wat led the Peasants' Revolt. Richard showed himself capable of reckless bravery when he faced the rebels at Mile End and Smithfield and saved the country from revolution. Then it seemed that he would be a worthy ruler. He enjoyed a happy marriage with Anne of Bohemia but his extravagance and tendency to surround himself with his favorites brought him into conflict with his people. His uncles, John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock, were caught up in the intrigue, and there came the day when the Five Lords Appellant faced Richard and threatened to depose him.Here is a vivid picture of Richard's court, of his extravagance and folly, of his devotion to his favorite, Robert de Vere, of his love for two queens, clever Anne and the little Isabella, and of his headlong journey toward disaster. He could never forget an injury and was determined to take his revenge on the five lords who had humiliated him. He succeeded with four of them but the fifth—Henry of Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt—was clever, subtle, and determined to triumph where his father had failed. Richard was no match for him and it was Bolingbroke who drove him along the last stretch of his passage to Pontefract.","['Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Fiction', 'Plantagenet', '14th Century', 'Romance', 'Medieval', 'Historical Romance']"

Samen met zijn vrienden, die een vervangende familiekring vormen voor zijn weggelopen moeder en zijn overleden broertje, probeert Blue Boy een zelfstandig bestaan op te bouwen..Deze beroemde roman van de Taiwanees-Amerikaanse auteur Pai Hsien-yung (1937) is een werk uit de vroege jaren tachtig. Het werd jaren geleden al vertaald in het Engels en is ook verfilmd. Het boek beschrijft de emotionele ontwikkeling van een jonge homo-prostitué in Taipei, de hoofdstad van Taiwan.

De nadruk van de roman ligt op de levensverhalen van de verschillende personages, waarin vaak de relatie tot de vader centraal staat, en waarin gevoelens van marginaliteit of verstotenheid voortdurend aan de oppervlakte komen. In sommige passages lijkt Pai te wijzen in de richting van een allegorie: de verstotenen in het homopark in Taipei staan model voor de gemeenschap van vasteland-Chinezen die in 1949 naar Taiwan moesten uitwijken. Belangrijker dan dit soort mogelijke politieke interpretaties zijn echter de vaak ontroerende individuele portretten die Pai schildert.","['Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'China', 'Asia', 'Gay', 'Literature', 'Chinese Literature', 'Novels', 'Classics']"

Women of Algiers in Their Apartment,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301501.Women_of_Algiers_in_Their_Apartment,"The cloth edition of Assia Djebar's Women of Algiers in Their Apartment, her first work to be published in English, was named by the American Literary Translators Association as an ALTA Outstanding Translation of the Year. Now available in paperback, this collection of three long stories, three short ones, and a theoretical postface by one of North Africa's leading writers depicts the plight of urban Algerian women who have thrown off the shackles of colonialism only to face a postcolonial regime that denies and subjugates them even as it celebrates the liberation of men. Denounced in Algeria for its political criticism, Djebar's book quickly sold out its first printing of 15,000 copies in France and was hugely popular in Italy. Her stylistically innovative, lyrical stories address the cloistering of women, the implications of reticence, the connection of language to oppression, and the impact of war on both women and men. The Afterword by Clarisse Zimra includes an illuminating interview with Djebar.","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Algeria', 'Africa', 'France', 'Feminism', 'African Literature', 'Womens', 'Literature', '20th Century']"

Αποτελείται από 31 πεζά κείμενα, λυρικής διάθεσης, τα οποία καλύπτουν μία μεγάλη χρονική περίοδο, γραμμένα από το 1958 μέχρι το 1965.Και τώρα ο καθείς θα διερωτηθή ευλόγως: «Μα τί θα πη Οκτάνα;»Δίκαιον το ερώτημα και η απάντησις θα έλθη γρήγορα. Όμως διά να γίνη πλήρως νοητή, ρίξετε πρώτα μέσα σας μια καλή ματιά και ευθύς μετά ρίξετε άλλη μία τριγύρω σας δεξιά και αριστερά, πάνω και κάτω. Έπειτα κλείστε τα μάτια σας για μια στιγμή και ανοίξτε τα αποτόμως, ανοίγοντας διάπλατα και τις ψυχές σας. Η απάντησις θα βρίσκεται μπροστά σας, όχι μονάχα νοητή, μα και απτή — σώμα περικαλλές και έμψυχον και σφύζον.Και τώρα (αμήν, αμήν) λέγω υμίν:Οκτάνα, φίλοι μου, θα πη μεταίχμιον της Γης και του Ουρανού, όπου το ένα στο άλλο επεκτεινόμενο ένα τα δύο κάνει.Οκτάνα θα πη πυρ, κίνησις, ενέργεια, λόγος σπέρμα.Οκτάνα θα πη έρως ελεύθερος με όλας τας ηδονάς του.Οκτάνα θα πη ανά πάσαν στιγμήν ποίησις, όμως όχι ως μέσον εκφράσεως μόνον, μα ακόμη ως λειτουργία του πνεύματος διηνεκής.Οκτάνα θα πη η εντελέχεια εκείνη, που αυτό που είναι αδύνατον να γίνη αμέσως το κάνει εν τέλει δυνατόν, ακόμη και την χίμαιραν, ακόμη και την ουτοπίαν, ίσως μια μέρα και την αθανασίαν του σώματος και όχι μονάχα της ψυχής.Οκτάνα θα πη το «εγώ» «εσύ» να γίνεται (και αντιστρόφως το «εσύ» «εγώ») εις μίαν εκτόξευσιν ιμερικήν, εις μίαν έξοδον λυτρωτικήν, εις μίαν ένωσιν θεοτικήν, εις μίαν μέθεξιν υπερτάτην, που ίσως αυτή να αποτελεί την θείαν Χάριν, το θαύμα του εντός και εκτός εαυτού, κάθε φοράν που εν εκστάσει συντελείται.Απόσπασμα από το ποίημα “Όχι Μπραζίλια μα Οκτάνα” (1965).",[]

It was on that sandy beach seventeen years ago that the strangled body of Jean Timberlake was found.The people of the town don't pay a whole lot of mind to past history, especially when Bailey Fowler, the self-confessed killer, had been convicted. They weren't even unduly concerned when, a year after the murder, Fowler walked away from the men's prison at San Luis Obispo, never to be seen again. After all, everyone knew Jean was a wild kid. ""Like mother, like daughter,"" some said--though never within hearing of Shana Timberlake who, whatever her faults, still mourned her murdered child.And then, by sheer fluke, the cops stumbled on Bailey Fowler. And a case seventeen years dead came murderously to life again. For Royce Fowler, old and sick with not much time left, his son's reappearance was the chance to heal an old wound. For Kinsey Millhone, the case was a long shot, but she agreed to take it on. She couldn't know then that it would lead her to probe passions buried just below the surface of family relations. That's where old wounds fester and the most cherished emotions become warped until they fuse into deadly, soul-destroying time bombs.","['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Detective', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Murder Mystery', 'Adult']"

The Hurried Child: Growing Up Too Fast Too Soon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2905542-the-hurried-child,"Often with the very best intentions, Americans expose their children to overwhelming pressures, pressures that can lead to low self-esteem, to teenage pregnancy, and even to teenage suicide. By blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting—or imposing—too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up too fast, to mimic adult sophistication while secretly yearning for innocence.With the first edition of The Hurried Child, David Elkind emerges as the voice of reason, calling our attention to the crippling effects of hurrying. But in the decade since this book first appeared, a new generation of parents has inadvertently stepped up the assault on childhood, misled by the new and comforting rhetoric of childhood ”competence.”Now Dr. Elkind has thoroughly revised this enormously successful book to debunk the notion of ”competence” tha thas children racing off to early enrichment programs, burdened by the pressure to ”achieve,” and coming home alone to an empty house after school. He sees ”sompetence” as a notion meant to rationalize the needs of adults, not to serve the genuine needs of kids, a notion that has fourth graders dieting to fit into designer jeans and children of divorce asked to be the confidants of their troubled parents.In updating this new edition, Dr. Elkind takes a detailed and up-to-the-minute look at the world of today's kids in terms of education, movies, television, rock & roll, and social trends, to see where the hyrrying occurs and why. And as before, he offers parents and teachers insight, advice, and hope for encouraging healthy development while protecting the joy and feedom of childhood.","['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Education', 'Childrens', 'Sociology', 'Teaching', 'Self Help', 'Mental Health', 'Family']"

Cinema 1: The Movement-Image,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150558.Cinema_1,"A revolutionary work in philosophy and a book about cinema that identifies three principal types of image-movement using examples from the work of a diverse group of filmmakers including Griffith, Eisenstein, Cassavetes, and Altman.First published in France in 1983, this is at once a revolutionary work in philosophy and a book about cinema. For Deleuze, philosophy cannot be a reflection of something else; philosophical concepts are, rather, the images of thought, to be understood on their own terms. Here he puts this view of philosophy to work in understanding the concepts—or images—of film.Cinema, to Deleuze, is not a language that requires probing and interpretation, a search for hidden meanings; it can be understood directly, as a composition of images and signs, pre-verbal in nature. Thus he offers a powerful alternative to the psychoanalytic and semiological approaches that have dominated film studies.Drawing upon Henri Bergson’s thesis on perception and C. S. Peirce’s classification of images and signs, Deleuze is able to put forth a new theory and taxonomy of the image, which he then applies to concrete examples from the work of a diverse group of filmmakers—Griffith, Eisenstein, Pasolini, Rohmer, Bresson, Dreyer, Stroheim, Buñuel, and many others. Because he finds movement to be the primary characteristic of cinema in the first half of the twentieth century, he devotes this first volume to that aspect of film. In the years since World War II, time has come to dominate film; that shift, and the signs and images associated with it, are addressed in .","['Film', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Art', 'France', 'Academic', 'Criticism', 'Essays', 'Research']"

Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/740082.Memories_of_Silk_and_Straw,"Over 50 reminiscences of pre-modern Japan—illustrations of a way of life that has virtually disappeared. Voted ""Best Book of the Year"" by Japan's foreign press.This is a collective biography, based on interviews taped by a small-town doctor, recording the lives of a cotton dyer, blacksmith, tofu maker, undertaker, carter, tenant farmer, local gangster, casual laborer, horse-meat butcher, magistrate's wife, apprentice geisha, rice merchant, thatcher,carpenter, midwife, county hangman, pawnbroker, draper, fisherman, hairdresser, servant, charcoal burner, and so on-over fifty in all. Their memories are all related to a lakeside town and its rural suburbs northeast of Tokyo.Born in the early years of this century, these people have both seen the old Japan and lived through the changes brought about by modernization and the onset of affluence. In a real sense, they provide the sole surviving links with a feudal way of life and its attitudes which have altered, in thespace of fifty years or so, beyond recognition.Through plain-spoken anecdote—their voices by turns amused, nostalgic, disturbing but unsensational—they describe their youth in a tougher world where poverty was commonplace, where unwanted children were sometimes ""thinned out'' at birth, where poorer families cooked out-of-doors and fishermen insummer went almost naked. By saving their memories for posterity, the author hoped to close, just a fraction, the gap in perception between a traditional past and the Japan we know today. The result—as the distinguished anthropologist, Ronald Dore, says in his preface—is ""a book to savor, and a bookto learn from.""These reminiscences are accompanied by illustrations painted by the author's father, Dr. Susumu Saga—themselves a record of an old man's past.","['Japan', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography', 'Cultural', 'Asian Literature']"

The Control of Nature,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77.The_Control_of_Nature,"While John McPhee was working on his previous book, Rising from the Plains, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: ""Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given."" In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--""the control of nature""--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) ""any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods."" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control.In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is.In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers.Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris.Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Nature', 'History', 'Environment', 'Essays', 'Geology', 'Natural History', 'Engineering', 'Ecology']"

Creating controversy and outrage when it was first published in the USSR—it was called by reviewers there a “slanderous piece of fantasy” and part of a “hysterical chorus of malign attacks”—Zinky Boys presents the candid and affecting testimony of the officers and grunts, nurses and prostitutes, mothers, sons, and daughters who describe the war and its lasting effects. What emerges is a story that is shocking in its brutality and revelatory in its similarities to the American experience in Vietnam. The Soviet dead were shipped back in sealed zinc coffins (hence the term “Zinky Boys”), while the state denied the very existence of the conflict. Svetlana Alexievich brings us the truth of the Soviet-Afghan War: the beauty of the country and the savage Army bullying, the killing and the mutilation, the profusion of Western goods, the shame and shattered lives of returned veterans. offers a unique, harrowing, and unforgettably powerful insight into the harsh realities of war.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Russia', 'War', 'Politics', 'Journalism', 'Nobel Prize']"

He shows us why it is important for us to respond to the Earth’s need for planetary renewal, and what we must do to break free of the “technological trance” that drives a misguided dream of progress. Only then, he suggests, can we foster mutually enhancing human-Earth relationships that can heal our traumatized global biosystem.","['Nature', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Environment', 'Ecology', 'Science', 'Theology', 'Essays', 'Sustainability']"

Het rommelt weliswaar onder de burgerij, maar dat neemt bij lange na niet zulke vormen aan als in Frankrijk en Amerika. Van der Capellen correspondeert met de 'nieuwlichters' in andere landen. Hij verzet zich in en buiten de Staten steeds meer tegen machtsmisbruik en de behandeling van de burger als een onmondige.In 1781 verschijnt er een hartstochtelijk pamflet tegen Willem V en zijn raadgevers: de bekende , een oproep aan de natie om oude vrijheden en rechten te verdedigen.

Damascus Nights,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13104083-damascus-nights,ثلاثة وعشرون ناشراً ألمانياً رفضوا طبع هذه الرواية. لم يخطر ببال أحد منهم أن قصة عن دمشف، وعن الحديث الشفهي، تهم أي قارئ ألماني، فالأدب العربي كان آنذاك قارة مجهولة. وكان رفيق شامي كاتباً مغموراً نشر سبعة كتب لم تلق نجاحاً يذكر. وبعد عناءٍ، أخذ مدير جديد لإحدى دور النشر النص، وأوكل أحد خبرائه بتنقيح الكتاب، فقصقص أجنحة القصة الدمشقية ليحولها إلى رواية أوروبية صغيرة لطيفة لا أثر فيها للشفاهية.كانت تلك اللحظة حاسمة في مسيرة رفيق شامي الأدبية. بعد تفكير دام ثلاثة أيام أبلغ الناشر أنه يرفض هذا التنقيح وأنه لا يريد تغيير سطر من أسطر الكتاب وكانت المفاجأة أجابه الناشر أنه عندما قرأ اقتراحات المحقق قال له: لن يقبل بهكذا مسخ لرواية أي كاتب يحترم نفسه. لذلك قرر أن يوكل رجلاً آخر بتدقيق لغة النص فقط والحفاظ عليها كما رواها رفيق شامي. وهكذا كان.صدر هذا الكتاب في تشرين الأول (أكتوبر) 1989م وبيع منه خلال السنة الأولى 200 ألف نسخة وبيعت حقوق الترجمة لـ 22 لغة. وبعد ثلاث سنوات حصد الكتاب ست جوائز أدبية وتجاوزت طبعاته حتى اليوم المليوني نسخة.,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'German Literature', 'Historical', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature']"

Modernity and the Holocaust,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/418471.Modernity_and_the_Holocaust,"A new afterword to this edition, ""The Duty to Remember, But What?"" tackles the difficult issues of guilt and innocence on the individual and societal levels. Zygmunt Bauman explores the silences found in debates about the Holocaust, and asks what the historical facts of the Holocaust tell us about the hidden capacities of present-day life. He finds great danger in such phenomena as the seductiveness of martyrdom; going to extremes in the name of safety; the insidious effects of tragic memory; and the efficient, ""scientific"" implementation of the death penalty. Bauman writes, ""Once the problem of the guilt of the Holocaust perpetrators has been by and large settled . . . the one big remaining question is the innocence of all the rest, not the least the innocence of ourselves.""Among the conditions that made the mass extermination of the Holocaust possible, according to Bauman, the most decisive factor was modernity itself. Bauman's provocative interpretation counters the tendency to reduce the Holocaust to an episode in Jewish history, or to one that cannot be repeated in the West precisely because of the progressive triumph of modern civilization. He demonstrates, rather, that we must understand the events of the Holocaust as deeply rooted in the very nature of modern society and in the central categories of modern social thought.","['Sociology', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Holocaust', 'Theory', 'Race', 'World War II', 'Jewish']"
Neveryóna,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81758.Nevery_na,"In his four-volume series Return to Nevèrÿon, Hugo and Nebula award-winner Samuel R.

Wesleyan University Press has reissued the long-unavailable Nevèrÿon volumes in trade paperback.The eleven stories, novellas, and novels in Return to Nevèrÿon's four volumes chronicle a long-ago land on civilization's brink, perhaps in Asia or Africa, or even on the Mediterranean. Taken slave in childhood, Gorgik gains his freedom, leads a slave revolt, and becomes a minister of state, finally abolishing slavery. Ironically, however, he is sexually aroused by the iron slave collars of servitude. Does this contaminate his mission - or intensify it? Presumably elaborated from an ancient text of unknown geographical origin, the stories are sunk in translators' and commentators' introductions and appendices, forming a richly comic frame.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Literature', 'Sword and Sorcery', 'LGBT', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Queer', 'Short Stories', 'Theory']"

On his return from Paris to his home city of Würtenburg, Ulrich Hargenau, whose father was executed for his involvement in the 1944 plot against Hitler, is compelled to ask himself, ""How German am l?""––as he compares his own recent attempt to save his life, and his wife Paula's, by testifying against fellow members of a terrorist group, with his father's selfless heroism. Through Ulrich––privileged, upper class––we confront the incongruities of the new democratic Germany, in particular the flourishing community of Brumholdstein, named after the country's greatest thinker, Brumhold, and built on the former site of a concentration camp. Paula's participation in the destruction of a police station; the State's cynical response to crush the terrorists; two attempts on Ulrich's life; the discovery in Brumholdstein of a mass grave of death camp inmates––all these, with subtle irony, are presented as pieces of a puzzle spelling out the turmoil of a society's endeavor to avoid the implications of its menacing heritage.","['Fiction', 'Germany', 'The United States Of America', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'German Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'American', 'Collections']"

Короткий запис спогадів. Історія Норильського повстання,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22820734,"Пропонуємо увазі читача «Короткий запис спогадів» Євгена Грицяка з двома додатками — зверненням до Миколи Підгорного, Голови Президії Верховної Ради СРСР в 1976 р. і листом до Комітету Сприяння Виконанню Гельсінкських Угод в 1977 році, які були поширені в самвидаві.Євген Грицяк — колишній член української молодечої націоналістичної організації у Снятині, червоноармієць, політв'язень, організатор норильського повстання, дослідник гіндуської філософії, український йогіст, а згодом постійна жертва сваволі КДБ. Ось в одному реченні — життя цієї небуденної людини, яку видало багате на таланти українське Покуття. Під постійним тиском репресійних органів в Україні, Євген Грицяк бажає виїхати з дружиною та дочкою в Індію, чи взагалі будь-куди. На численні заяви покинути СРСР йому постійно відповідають: «Знищимо, зітремо з лиця землі, але нікуди не відпустимо!»Ім'я Євгена Грицяка записане в історію українського спротиву нацистським і російсько-червоним окупантам поруч з багатьма учасниками українського визвольного руху.Народився Євген Грицяк в 1926 р. в селі Стецева біля Снятина (тепер Івано-Франківська область). Перед вибухом Другої світової війни був учнем гімназії у Снятині, а під час німецької окупації — студентом середньої торговельної школи. Саме тоді він співпрацював з молодечою націоналістичною організацією, яка готувала молодь до боротьби з нацистськими окупантами. Не почуваючи себе ні в чому винним, він не тікав перед надходячою в 1944 р. Червоною армією, що вже незабаром зайняла цілу Україну. Зразу він був мобілізований, і в рядах Червоної армії перебував аж до 1949 р. Був вояком 4-го Українського Фронту, і під час боїв був поранений і нагороджений.В 1949 році радянська контррозвідка викрила його «минуле» (співпраця з молодечою українською націоналістичною організацією). Він був заарештований, засуджений на кару смерти, яку замінено на 25 років ув'язнення. В тюрмах і концтаборах перебував разом з Михайлом Сорокою, Данилом Шумуком, Юрком Шухевичем, д-ром Володимиром Горбовим і багатьма іншими незламними українськими політв'язнями.Данило Шумук у своїх спогадах «За східнім обрієм» (в-во «Смолоскип», 1974 р.), хоч і критично висловлюється про методи, які застосовував Є.Грицяк в зорганізуванні норильського повстання, все ж віддає йому належне: «це був безкорисний, чесний, розумний і спостережливий чоловік» (стор. 292 ). Д.Шумук пише, що Є.Грицяк захопився йогою, мав хист до малювання, до чужих мов; вивчив голкотерапію, яку практикував у часі ув'язнення. «У побуті,— пише Д. Шумук,— Євген Грицяк був дуже чесною людиною, йому можна довірити найбільші скарби, і він, навіть умираючи з голоду, не взяв би жодного грама» (стор. 425). «Те, що для інших,— пише він в іншому місці,— було неможливим, то для Євгена було можливим. Він міг піднятися з попелу і знову стати сповненою гідности людиною» (стор. 426).Дуже тепло згадує про Євгена Грицяка єврейський активіст, колишній в'язень радянських тюрем і концтаборів Авраам Шифрін у книжці спогадів «Четвертий вимір» (в-во «Сучасність», 1973 р.), з яким він подружив і навіть разом перекладав з англійської мови книжку відомого індійського письменника Ананді.У 1977 р. Євген Грицяк пішов на одчайдушний крок: він поїхав до Москви, зустрінувся з кореспондентом американської газети «Чікаґо Трібюн» і дав йому інтерв'ю, розказавши про норильське повстання і безперервне переслідування, що його він зазнає з боку КДБ.У розповіді «Короткий запис спогадів» читач пізнає скромного і чесного українського патріота. Обставини ув'язнення Є. Грицяка і трагічна доля його товаришів не залишили його байдужим. Він очолив норильське повстання, кинувшись у вир боротьби з безправ'ям і свавіллям радянського режиму.Історія самооборони українських політв'язнів в радянських концтаборах, людська гідність, нездоланність і мужність — світлими літерами вписали ім'я Євгена Грицяка на своїх сторінках.Друкуючи спогади Є. Грицяка, ми повністю зберігаємо його стиль і фразеологію, за винятком тільки незначних правописних змін.",[]

The first of the poems is the unpublished Lay of The Children of Hurin, narrating on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. The second is the moving Lay of Leithian, the chief source of the tale of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion, telling of the Quest of the Silmaril and the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, Tolkien's friend and colleague, who read the poem in 1929. By assuming that this poem is actually a fragment from a past lost in history, Lewis underlined the remarkable power of its author's imaginative talents and academic competence.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Reference', 'Mythology', 'Literature']"

Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132779.Vengeance,"Vengeance is a true story that reads like a novel. It is the account of five ordinary Israelis, selected to vanish into ""the cold"" of espionage secrecy -- their mission to hunt down and kill the PLO terrorists responsible for the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.This is the account of that secret mission, as related by the leader of the group -- the first Mossad agent to come out of ""deep cover"" and tell the story of a heroic endeavor that was shrouded in silence and speculation for years. He reveals the long and dangerous operation whose success was bought at a terrible cost to the idealistic volunteer agents themselves.""Avner"" was the leader of that team, handpicked by Golda Meir to avenge the monstrous crime of Munich. He and his young companions, cut off from any direct contact with Israel, set out systematically to find and kill the central figures of the PLO's Munich operation, tracking them down wherever they lived.The mechanics, the horror, the day-by-day suspense of what they did surpass by far anything John le Carré or Robert Ludlum could imagine, as they themselves were tracked in turn (and some killed) by PLO assassins, changing identities constantly, moving from country to country, devoting their young lives to the brutal task of vengeance.Vengeance is a profoundly human document, a real-life espionage classic that plunges the reader into the shadow world of terrorism and political murder. But it goes far beyond that, to explore firsthand the feelings of disgust and doubt that gradually came to torment each member of the Israeli team, and that in the end inexorably changed their view of the mission -- and themselves.Vengeance opens a window onto a secret world, a book that at the same time inspires and horrifies. For its subject is an act of revenge that goes to the very heart of the ancient biblical questions of good and evil.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Israel', 'Politics', 'Espionage', 'Terrorism', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'True Crime', 'Military History']"

The arguments and controversies it has aroused are, furthermore, far from abating: the disintegration of the Soviet bloc, the emergence of new social and political identities linked to the transformation of late capitalism, and the crisis of a left-wing project whose essentialist underpinnings have increasingly come under fire have, if anything, made more relevant than ever the theoretical perspective that the book proposes. Moreover the political project of ‘radical and plural democracy’ that it advocates provides a much-needed antidote to the attempts to formulate a Third Way capable of overcoming the classical opposition between Left and Right.Updated with a new preface, this is a fundamental text for understanding the workings of hegemony and grasping the nature of contemporary social struggles and their significance for democratic theory.","['Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Economics', 'Research', 'Social Science']"

"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86098.Contingency_Irony_and_Solidarity,"In this book, major American philosopher Richard Rorty argues that thinkers such as Nietzsche, Freud, and Wittgenstein have enabled societies to see themselves as historical contingencies, rather than as expressions of underlying, ahistorical human nature, or as realizations of suprahistorical goals. This ironic perspective on the human condition is valuable but it cannot advance liberalism's social and political goals. In fact, Rorty believes that it is literature and not philosophy that can do this, by promoting a genuine sense of human solidarity. Specifically, it is novelists such as Orwell and Nabokov who succeed in awakening us to the cruelty of particular social practices and individual attitudes. Thus, a truly liberal culture would fuse the private, individual freedom of the ironic, philosophical perspective with the public project of human solidarity as it is engendered through the insights and sensibilities of great writers. Rorty uses a wide range of references--from philosophy to social theory to literary criticism--to elucidate his beliefs.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Theory', 'Criticism', 'American', 'Literary Criticism', 'Cultural Studies', 'Humanities', 'Society']"

Prisoner of Love,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85373.Prisoner_of_Love,"Starting in 1970, Jean Genet—petty thief, prostitute, modernist master—spent two years in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan. Always an outcast himself, Genet was drawn to this displaced people, an attraction that was to prove as complicated for him as it was enduring. Prisoner of Love, written some ten years later, when many of the men Genet had known had been killed, and he himself was dying, is a beautifully observed description of that time and those men as well as a reaffirmation of the author's commitment not only to the Palestinian revolution but to rebellion itself. For Genet's most overtly political book is also his most personal—the last step in the unrepentantly sacrilegious pilgrimage first recorded in and a searching meditation, packed with visions, ruses, and contradictions, on such life-and-death issues as the politics of the image and the seductive and treacherous character of identity. Genet's final masterpiece is a lyrical and philosophical voyage to the bloody intersection of oppression, terror, and desire, at the heart of the contemporary world.","['Fiction', 'France', 'Queer', 'French Literature', 'LGBT', 'Classics', '20th Century', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Literature']"

Briefe und Aufzeichnungen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1747525.Briefe_und_Aufzeichnungen,"Personal letters and diaries provide an intimate view into the hearts and minds of a brother and sister who became martyrs in the anti-Nazi resistance during World War II.Idealistic, serious, and sensible, Hans and Sophie Scholl joined the Hitler Youth with youthful and romantic enthusiasm. But as Hitler's grip throttled Germany and Nazi atrocities mounted, Hans and Sophie emerged from their adolescence with the conviction that at all costs they must raise their voices against the murderous Nazi regime.In May of 1942, with Germany still winning the war, an improbable little band of students at Munich University began distributing the leaflets of the White Rose. In the very city where the Nazis got their start, they demanded resistance to Germany's war efforts and confronted their readers with what they had learned of Hitler's ""final solution"" ""Here we see the most terrible crime committed against the dignity of humankind, a crime that has no counterpart in human history.""These broadsides were secretly drafted and printed in a Munich basement by Hans Scholl, by now a young medical student and military conscript, and a handful of young co-conspirators that included his twenty-one-year-old sister Sophie. The leaflets placed the Scholls and their friends in mortal danger, and it wasn't long before they were captured and executed. but rather came to their convictions through personal spiritual search that eventually led them to sacrifice their lives for what they believed was right. Interwoven with commentary on the progress of Hitler's campaign, the letters and diary entries range from veiled messages about the course of a war they wanted their country to lose, to descriptions of hikes and skiing trips and meditations on Goethe, Dostoyevsky, Rilke, and Verlaine; from entreaties to their parents for books and sweets hard to get in wartime, to deeply humbled and troubled entreaties to God for an understanding of the presence of such great evil in the world. There are alarms when Hans is taken into military custody, when their father is jailed, and when their friends are wounded on the eastern front. But throughout--even to the end, when the Scholls' sense of peril is most oppressive--there appear in their writings spontaneous outbursts of joy and gratitude for the gifts of nature, music, poetry, and art. In the midst of evil and degradation, theirs is a celebration of the spiritual and the humane. of Hans and Sophie Scholl and their friends and co-conspirators.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Germany', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'War', 'Holocaust', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Biography']"

Up to 1905 the tsarist government forbade the public use of Ukrainian beyond belles-lettres, and excluded it from education until 1917. In the interwar period the country was divided among the USSR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, and social and cultural conditions differed drastically. Shevelov's book, based on extensive study of factual material, traces the development of Modern Standard Ukrainian in relation to the political, legal, and cultural conditions within each region. It examines the relation of the standard language to the underlying dialects, the ways in which the standard language was enriched, and the complex struggle for the unity of the language and sometimes for its very existence. While shunning excess linguistic terminology, the book presents the essentials of linguistic development in connection with broad political and cultural conditions.","['Linguistics', 'Ukraine']"

A story of infatuation and disappointment, betrayal and revenge, is essentially a comedy. But the powerful presence of Freud himself and the harsh bracing air of his ideas about unconscious life hover over the narrative and give it a tragic dimension.","['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychoanalysis', 'History', 'Biography', 'Journalism', '20th Century', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Essays']"

And how does the new form of communication affect the content and meaning of texts? In this book, one of the most original and penetrating thinkers in Greek studies describes the transformation from orality to literacy in classical times and reflects upon its continued meaning for us today.“Fresh insights into the orality-literacy shift in human consciousness from one who has long been studying this shift in ancient Greece and has now brought his vast learning and reflections to bear on our own times. This book is for a wide audience and calls for thoroughly rethinking current views on language, thought, and society from classical scholarship through modern philosophy, anthropology, and poststructuralism.”—Walter J. Ong“All in all, we have in this book the summary statement of one of the great pioneers in the study of oral and literate culture, fascinating in its scope and rewarding in its sophistication. As have his other works, this book will contribute mightily to curing the biases resulting from our own literacy.”—J. Peter Denny,“An extremely useful summary and extension of the revisionist thinking of Eric Havelock, whom most classicists and comparatists would rank among the premier classical scholars of the last three decades. . . .

The Scapegoat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/604562.The_Scapegoat,"Widely regarded as one of the most profound critics of our time, René Girard has pursued a powerful line of inquiry across the fields of the humanities and the social sciences. His theories, which the French press has termed ""l'hypothèse girardienne,"" have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to ""texts of persecution,"" documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor--documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut's Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard's answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence--a demystification Girard now extends to mythology.Underlying Girard's daring textual hypothesis is a powerful theory of history and culture. Christ's rejection of all guilt breaks the mythic cycle of violence and the sacred. The scapegoat becomes the Lamb of God; ""the foolish genesis of blood-stained idols and the false gods of superstition, politics, and ideologies"" are revealed.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Theology', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Christianity', 'Politics']"

As a unique popular culture form, MTV warrants attention, and in this, the first study of the medium, originally published in 1987, E. Ann Kaplan examines the cultural context of MTV and its relationship to the history of rock music. The first part of the book focuses on MTV as a commercial institution, on the contexts of production and exhibition of videos, on their similarity to ads, and on the different perspectives of directors and viewers. Does the adoption of adolescent styles and iconography signal an open-minded acceptance of youth’s subversive stances; or does it rather suggest a cynicism by which profit has become the only value?In the second part of the book, Kaplan turns to the rock videos themselves, and from the mass of material that flows through MTV she identifies five distinct types of video: the ‘romantic’, the ‘socially conscious’, the ‘nihilistic’, the ‘classical’, and the ‘postmodern’. There are detailed analyses of certain videos; and Kaplan focuses particularly on gender issues in videos by both male and female stars. The final chapter explores the wider implications of MTV.

By demystifying the fantasies surrounding cancer, Sontag shows cancer for what it is--just a disease. Cancer, she argues, is not a curse, not a punishment, certainly not an embarrassment and, it is highly curable, if good treatment is followed.Almost a decade later, with the outbreak of a new, stigmatized disease replete with mystifications and punitive metaphors, Sontag wrote a sequel to , extending the argument of the earlier book to the AIDS pandemic.These two essays now published together, and , have been translated into many languages and continue to have an enormous influence on the thinking of medical professionals and, above all, on the lives of many thousands of patients and caregivers.","['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Medicine', 'Disability', 'Health', 'Theory', 'History', 'Science', 'Queer']"
Hegemony and Revolution: Antonio Gramsci's Political and Cultural Theory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189232.Hegemony_and_Revolution,"As a result of his inquiry into the nature of class, culture, and the state, Antonio Gramsci became one of the most influential Marxist theorists. Hegemony and Revolution is the first full-fledged study of Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks in the light of his pre-prison career as a socialist and communist militant and a highly original Marxist intellectual. Walter Adamson shows how Gramsci’s concepts of revolution grew out of his experience with the Turin worker councils of 1919–1920 as well as his experience combatting the Fascist movement. For Gramsci, revolution meant the steady ascension of a mass-based, educated, and organized “collective will,” in which the final seizure of power would be the climax of a broader educative process. Success depended on countering not just the coercive power of the existing economic and political order but also the cultural hegemony of the state. A “counter-hegemony” for Gramsci required the leadership of an organized political party, but at its core lay his conviction that the common people were capable of self-enlightenment and could produce an alternative conception of the world that challenged the prevailing hegemonic culture. Adamson shows how these ideas, which Gramsci developed prior to his imprisonment, led him to a highly original concept of “subaltern” class movements that cohere not just on the basis of economic interest but by virtue of religious, ideological, regional, folkloric, and other sorts of cultural ties as well. These ideas of Gramsci have had enormous influence on a wide variety of subsequent cultural theories including postcolonialism and Foucault-style analyses of discursive practices. Winner of the Society for Italian History’s Howard Marraro Prize, Hegemony and Revolution is an essential resource for scholars of the humanities and social sciences. Walter L. Adamson earned his PhD in the History of Ideas from Brandeis University in 1976. He taught at Whitman College and then at Harvard University as a Mellon Fellow in the Humanities, after which he joined the Emory University faculty in 1978. At Emory he teaches a variety of courses in modern European intellectual history and Italian history from the Risorgimento forward, with particular attention to fascism, nationalism, and imperialism. He is the former Chair of the Emory History Department. Dr. Adamson has authored a number of books including Marx and the Disillusionment of Marxism ; the award-winning Avant-garde From Modernism to Fascism ; and Embattled Modernism’s Resistance to Commodity Culture in Europe .","['Politics', 'Sociology']"

The scheme, simply put, is to get married for the gifts. But Gilbert, who's gay, needs a fiancée... Enter Moira Finch, a demonically conniving young woman whose own mother, having recently married the Duke of Dorsetshire, will contribute richly to the couple's receipts. Enter, too, Philip Cavanaugh, Gilbert's longtime friend, former lover, and highly strung Best Man. And enter, finally, the Cellinis, Gilbert's huge internecine step-family, whose fortune has not been amassed as innocently as Gilbert first believed.As Gilbert, Moira, and Philip struggle to keep their plot under wraps, the scams get bigger and more perilous, deceit multiplies, and a wonderfully calamitous trail leads us toward what could be the wedding of the season.","['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Gay', 'LGBT', 'Comedy', 'Queer', 'Gay Fiction', 'New York', 'Contemporary', 'Novels']"

Creole Folktales,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443564.Creole_Folktales,"Patrick Chamoiseau first became known to the international literary world with Texaco , the vast and demanding novel that won France's prestigious Goncourt Prize in 1992. Less well known is the fact that Chamoiseau has written a number of extraordinary books about his childhood in Martinique. One of these, Creole Folktales , recreates in truly magical language the stories he heard as a child. Folktales with a twist, fairy tales with attitude, these stories are told in a language as savory as the spicy food so lovingly evoked within these pages. The urchins, dowagers, ne'er-do-wells, and gluttons in these tales are filled with longing for the simple things in a full plate, a safe journey, a good night's sleep. But their world is haunted, and the material comforts we take for granted are the stuff of dreams for them, for there are always monsters waiting to snatch away their tasty bowl of stew―or even life itself. Some of these monsters are the wicked hag, the envious neighbor, the deceitful suitor, the devil who gobbles up unwary souls. Others may be surprising, and their casual appearance in these tales makes them all the more frightening―like an unexpected glimpse into a fun-house mirror. But in contrast to these folktales' more fantastic creations, the white plantation owner and the slave ship's captain remind us that these are stories of survival in a colonized land. A marvelous introduction to a world, both real and imaginary, that North Americans have ignored for far too long.","['Short Stories', 'Folklore', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Africa', 'Folk Tales', 'France', 'Literature']"

Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134571.Science_in_Action,"Science and technology have immense authority and influence in our society, yet their working remains little understood. The conventional perception of science in Western societies has been modified in recent years by the work of philosophers, sociologists and historians of science. In this book Bruno Latour brings together these different approaches to provide a lively and challenging analysis of science, demonstrating how social context and technical content are both essential to a proper understanding of scientific activity. Emphasizing that science can only be understood through its practice, the author examines science and technology in action: the role of scientific literature, the activities of laboratories, the institutional context of science in the modern world, and the means by which inventions and discoveries become accepted. From the study of scientific practice he develops an analysis of science as the building of networks. Throughout, Bruno Latour shows how a lively and realistic picture of science in action alters our conception of not only the natural sciences but also the social sciences and the sociology of knowledge in general.This stimulating book, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide range of scientific activities, will interest all philosophers, sociologists and historians of science, scientists and engineers, and students of the philosophy of social science and the sociology of knowledge.","['Science', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Academic', 'Anthropology', 'Technology', 'History Of Science', 'Social Science']"

Robert Dahl examines the most basic assumptions of democratic theory, tests them against the questions raised by its critics, and recasts the theory of democracy into a new and coherent whole. He concludes by discussing the directions in which democracy must move if advanced democratic states are to exist in the future.“When Robert Dahl speaks about democracy, everyone should listen. With Democracy and Its Critics Dahl has produced a work destined to become another classic.”―Lucian W.

Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30617.Jack,"As I walked away from New Buildings, I found the man that Lewis had called ""Tollers"" sitting on one of the stone steps in front of the arcade. ""How did you get on?"" he asked. ""I think rather well. I think he will be a most interesting tutor to have."" ""Interesting? Yes, he's certainly that,"" said the man, who I later learned was J. R. R. Tolkien. ""You'll never get to the bottom of him."" Over the next twenty-nine years, author George Sayer's first impression about C. S. Lewis proved true. He was interesting; but he was more than just that. He was a devout Christian, gifted literary scholar, best-selling author, and brilliant apologist. Sayer draws from a variety of sources, including his close friendship with Lewis and the million-word diary of Lewis's brother, to paint a portrait of the man whose friends knew him as Jack. Offering glimpses into Lewis's extraordinary relationships and experiences, Jack details the great scholar's life at the Kilns; days at Magdalen College; meetings with the Inklings; marriage to Joy Davidman Gresham; and the creative process that produced such world-famous works as the classic Chronicles of Narnia, Mere Christianity , and The Screwtape Letters . This book is an intimate account of the man who helped―and through his works, continues to help―generations hear and understand the heart of Christianity.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Biography Memoir', 'Christianity', 'History', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'British Literature']"

It is a familiar and much-loved British institution that after more than twenty years continues to enjoy enormous success both at home and abroad.The Key to Time marks the programme's coming of age — twenty-one years old on 23 November 1984. Peter Haining has adopted the novel technique of exploring the history of the series through key dates in its many life-cycles. He demonstrates — with extensive reference to files kept in the Doctor Who Production Office — how much a part of British life the programme has become, and how the impact of this extraordinary phenomenon has travelled further afield. He traces the many changes the series has undergone since the first episode was broadcast in November 1963 — not only in terms of regenerated Doctors but also new methods of programme-making. The beginning of the Jon Pertwee era coincided with the switchover from black-and-white to colour, but Peter Haining also gives details of how many of the special effects were achieved, and how this initially modest television series pioneered techniques used in the multi-million-dollar Star Wars.The enthusiastic support of viewers all over the world has contributed to Doctor Who's long and happy life, and The Key to Time includes tributes from fans in Britain, Australia, Canada and the United States, in the form of drawings and sketches inspired by the series.This extensively illustrated special publication, with twenty-four pages of colour photographs, is a superb follow-up to the runaway success of W.H.

The poems progress geographically and chronologically with a cohesive development of ideas and themes. In part he plays off T. S. Eliot’s “summarizing the past by theft and allusion” but captures the present as well in fleeting incidents of daily experience, and, in his powerful concluding poem “History of the A TV Docu-drama,” envisions a possible nuclear future.

Living with his family in a poverty-stricken seaport village, the hero, Hassan Omar, is surrounded by a self-perpetuating cycle of violence and despair. His own sense of hopelessness is nurtured by the stunted lives around him: his drunken, tyrannical, libertine father; a sister, who escapes the blind-alley of their lives into headlong promiscuity; a dissolute older brother, who succumbs to the squalor and eventually dies in a freakish accident; and finally, his mother, who has fatalistically resigned herself to being brutalized by her husband. Eventually, Hassan leaves his family to stay with an uncle in Nairobi, and there he discovers a larger world, which contains its share of cruelty as well but also hope and redemptiona way out of his old life and his immobilizing self-hatred. Hassan's rite of passage eventually comes to stand for something larger, although Gurnah, who was born in Tanzania and now teaches in an English university, merely suggests this message: the hero's aspirations and dilemmas reflect the struggles of Third World Africa to shed its colonial skin, with its tradition of poverty and oppression, and to construct a new identity for itself. This is a short book, but dense, often hair-raising in its dramatic scenes of degradation and compelling in its rendering of Hassan's evolving consciousness.","['Fiction', 'Africa', 'Tanzania', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Nobel Prize', '20th Century', 'African Literature', 'Historical']"

It is here that agents are brought to be trained, disciplined, and when necessary, broken.In shocking fashion, Suvorov recounts the first day of training when he is forced to watch a film that shows a disaffected GRU agent being burned alive. This is how the GRU reveals to its trainees that there is only one way out of the organization – death. Other GRU methods are as physically torturous as the viewing of that film is terrifying: electric shocks used to punish a failure of memory; being pushed off a speeding train; hand-to-hand combat with death row prisoners recruited for their viciousness. All are employed in the training of a top agent.It is the agent's job – once he is in the field – to gather information in any way he can. No source of information is too small or too banal. Agents of the GRU are said to have attended every exhibition on the planet in the last fifty years – from exhibits of military electronics and tanks to cats and flowers, with one of their most successful missions carried out at an exhibition of Chinese goldfish. Above all else, loyalty to the GRU is stressed. Agents are to trust no one and to be prepared to take even the life of a best friend for an act against the GRU. Gradually, Suvorov became disillusioned with the GRU, and it was when he was forced to betray one of his best friends that he made up his mind to defect.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Espionage', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'Historical', 'Memoir', 'Military History']"

An instant bestseller in Canada, the firstvolume of The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery covers the years up to 1910 and culminates in the publication of Anne of Green Gables . The second volume (1910-1921) portrays Montgomery in the midst of great upheaval, both in her life and in the world around her. Now, the long-awaited thirdvolume brings us through her middle years, a time when Montgomery's personal and professional lives are becoming even more complex.Ranging from 1921-1929, this revealing journal documents her efforts to juggle the demands of motherhood, parish obligations, indifferent household help, grief at the loss of older friends and family--everyday struggles to balance a woman's social and domestic duties. Here she writes of thetriumphs and trials of being a best-selling growing fame; the successful midwifery of her new heroines Emily and Marigold and a more adult novel, The Blue Castle ; the struggle to allocate time for correspondence with publishers, fans, friends--and to actually write. We trace the happyconclusion of her lawsuits against an unscrupulous publisher and the disappointing outcome of a lawsuit arising in a minor automobile accident. And we learn of her personal Ewan Macdonalds's envy of his wife's publishing and social success; the dark shadow cast by his attacks ofmelancholia; and her fear that her sons might evince similar tendencies.In these years, Lucy Maud Montgomery turned more and more to her journals to record her insights, opinions, and epiphanies. These journals will not only intrigue every fan of Anne of Green Gables and the other Anne books, but will also provide an intimate look at life as portrayed by thisremarkable writer.","['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Canada', 'Journal', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Classics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']"

Rejecting the conventional monolithic concept of a 'society', Dr. Mann's model is instead one of a series of overlapping, intersecting power networks. He makes this model operational by focusing on the logistics of power - how the flow of information, manpower, and goods is controlled over social and geographical space-thereby clarifying many of the 'great debates' in sociological theory.

Pressure Drop,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/994627.Pressure_Drop,"Now acknowledged as perhaps the strongest of the new generation of thriller writers, Peter Abraham’s has found a striking new arena for action, adventure and suspense in the world of underwater diving: those mysterious caverns known as “blue holes” in the Bahamas.The only thing Nina Kitchener misses in her life is a family. She has a great PR career, a best friend, a good life, but a lot of failed relationships with men and...a biological clock that is clanging away. Resolved to listen to it, she decides to have a baby on her own by artificial insemination and, following the advice of a reputable doctor, visits the distinguished but mysterious Human Fertility Institute. Eventually, Nina gives birth to a healthy, beautiful baby boy, but before she can even name him he is kidnapped from the nursery.Helpless and alone, faced with an indifferent police bureaucracy, Nina becomes convinced that to find her baby she must discover the identity of the sperm donor. When she returns to the Institute, it has closed down. Desperate, she finds herself on the track of the wealthy family who funded it, in a world totally foreign to her, the Bahamas. There she meets the great diver, the maverick Matthias, a man unlike any she has known, with his own reasons for dredging this mystery from the deep.A story of two people from different worlds, working towards different ends, who together turn up a world of horrors in the deep, resonating in the wartime mysteries of Nazi survivors, a fatal dive that has ruined Matthias, and a strange world of Bahamian aristocrats whose stunning past can still compel the future. Coming together as strangers—believing romance to be history—they will find themselves in a profoundly satisfying and grown-up love affair.“A good thriller needs style, atmosphere and a surprising plot,” said The New York Times Book Review of Abraham’s last book, “and Hard Rain... has all of these and something extra: depth of feeling.” Powerfully novelistic, plotted with riveting suspense, Abraham’s new thriller has thrust his work up a whole new notch in craft, providing us with the ultimate story of jeopardy.","['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Adult', 'Writing']"

But it is more: Peter Nadas has given us a superb contemporary psychological novel that comes to terms with the ghosts, corpses, and repressed nightmares of Europe's recent past. ""A Book of Memories"" is made up of three first-person narratives: the first that of a young Hungarian writer and his fated love for a German poet; we also learn of the narrator's adolescence in Budapest, when he experiences the downfall of his once-upper-class but now pro-Communist family and of his beloved but repudiated father, a state prosecutor who commits suicide after the 1956 uprising. A second memoir, alternating with the first, is a novel the narrator is composing about a refined Belle Epoque aesthete, whose anti-bourgeois transgressions seem like emotionally overcharged versions of the narrator's own experiences. A third voice is that of a childhood friend who, after the narrator's return to his homeland, offers an apparently more objective account of their friendship.

Against Theory: Literary Studies and the New Pragmatism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662010.Against_Theory,"""Against Theory,"" the title essay in this volume, challenges the notion that literary theory has any real work to do, or any results to show. This challenge—issued by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels in Critical Inquiry (8:4)—strikes some critics as scandalous, others as provocative and productive.The argument is directed against both sides of the current debates in literary theory, criticizing theoretical ""objectivists"" like E. D. Hirsch, Jr., on the one hand, and proponents of indeterminacy like Paul de Man on the other. The attack is not just on a particular way of doing theory but on the entire project of literary theory. The challenge is not only to a way of thinking and writing but to a way of making a living.The resulting controversy has drawn so much attention among literary critics that it has been collected in a single volume so that the debate can be followed from start to finish. This collection includes the essay ""Against Theory,"" seven responses to it, and a rejoinder by Knapp and Michaels (originally published in Critical Inquiry 9:4); in addition, there are two new statements plus a final reply by Knapp and Michaels.The debate chronicled in this volume raises the most fundamental issues in the theory of meaning and the practice of interpretation. Are Knapp and Michaels confronting literary theory with a new ""pragmatic"" form of theory? Or are they (as some of their respondents suggest) arguing for a new form of nihilism? ""If it is a nihilism,"" writes editor W. J. T. Mitchell, ""it is one that demands an answer, not easy polemical dismissal, one that calls for theory to clarify its claims, not to mystify them and the easy assurance of intellectual fashion and institutional authority."" It is the intention of Against Theory to aid in that clarification.",['Literary Criticism']

Sherman's Devastating March through Georgia and the CarolinasSherman's March is the vivid narrative of General William T. Sherman's devastating sweep through Georgia and the Carolinas in the closing days of the Civil War. Weaving together hundreds of eyewitness stories, Burke Davis graphically brings to life the dramatic experiences of the 65,000 Federal troops who plundered their way through the South and those of the anguished -- and often defiant -- Confederate women and men who sought to protect themselves and their family treasures, usually in vain. Dominating these events is the general himself -- ""Uncle Billy"" to his troops, the devil incarnate to the Southerners he encountered.""What gives this narrative its unusual richness is the author's collation of hundreds of eyewitness accounts...The actions are described in the words, often picturesque and often eloquent, of those who were there, either as participants -- Union soldiers, Confederate soldiers -- in the fighting and destruction or as victims of Sherman's frank vow to 'make Georgia howl.' Mr. Davis intercuts these scenes with closeups of the chief actors in this nightmarish drama, and he also manages to give us a coherent historical account of the whole episode. A powerful illustration of the proposition put forth in Sherman's most famous remark."" -- The New Yorker","['History', 'Civil War', 'Nonfiction', 'American Civil War', 'War', 'American History', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Biography', 'Civil War History']"

Each has a peculiar economy; each commands an emotional allegiance from its citizens. Some are made topographically distinct by mountains, deserts, rivers. Others are defined by attitudes, ways of making a living, music, and language. Few are contained by lines that now describe ""Canada,"" ""Mexico,"" ""the United States.""

All That Is Native and Fine: The Politics of Culture in an American Region,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1134094.All_That_Is_Native_and_Fine,"In the American imagination, the word Appalachia designates more than a geographical region. It evokes fiddle tunes, patchwork quilts, split-rail fences, and all the other artifacts that decorate a cherished romantic region of the American mind. David Whisnant challenges this view of Appalachia (and consequently this broader imaginitive tendency) by exploring connections between a comforting cultural myth and the troublesome complexities of cultural history. Looking at the work of some ballad hunters and collectors, handicraft revivalists, folk festival promoters, and other cultural missionaries, Whisnant discovers a process of intentional and systematic cultural intervention that had (and still has) far-reaching consequences. Why, Whisnant asks, did so many Bluegrass ladies and upper-class graduates of Seven Sisters colleges rush to erect cultural breakwaters around mountaineers? Why would a sophisticated New England woman build a Danish folk school in western North Carolina? Why did a classical musician from Richmond who hated blacks love southern mountain music? How did the notions and actions of all these cultural missionaries affect the lives of the mountaineers? And what do these episodes of intervention teach us about culture and cultural change--in Appalachia and elsewhere? Whisnant pursues these and other questions in closely documented case studies of the Hindman Settlement School in eastern Kentucky, the cultural work of Olive Dame Campbell throughout the mountains, and the White Top Folk Festival on the Virginia-North Carolina border. Moreover, he relates them to broader social and economic developments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: the comingof the railroads and the opening of the mines, the Depression, the advent of TVA, and more diffuse processes such as urbanization, the decline of agriculture, the movement of radio and the commercial recording industry into the mountains, and the implicit restrictions Victorian America placed on the political perspectives and activities of socially conscious upper-class women. We must begin to understand the politics of culture, Whisnant writes, especially the role of formal institutions and foreceful individuals in defining and shaping perspectives, values, tastes and agendas for cultural change. All That Is Native and Fine opens the way not only to a reexamination of the history of a single region but also to a more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of cultural continuity and change in other regions and in the nation as a whole.","['Folklore', 'History']"

Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178680.Slavery_and_Social_Death,"This is the first full-scale comparative study of the nature of slavery. In a work of prodigious scholarship and enormous breadth, which draws on the tribal, ancient, premodern, and modern worlds, Orlando Patterson discusses the internal dynamics of slavery in sixty-six societies over time. These include Greece and Rome, medieval Europe, China, Korea, the Islamic kingdoms, Africa, the Caribbean islands, and the American South. Slavery is shown to be a parasitic relationship between master and slave, invariably entailing the violent domination of a natally alienated, or socially dead, person. The phenomenon of slavery as an institution, the author argues, is a single process of recruitment, incorporation on the margin of society, and eventual manumission or death.Distinctions abound in this work. Beyond the reconceptualization of the basic master-slave relationship and the redefinition of slavery as an institution with universal attributes, Patterson rejects the legalistic Roman concept that places the ""slave as property"" at the core of the system. Rather, he emphasizes the centrality of sociological, symbolic, and ideological factors interwoven within the slavery system. Along the whole continuum of slavery, the cultural milieu is stressed, as well as political and psychological elements. Materialistic and racial factors are deemphasized. The author is thus able, for example, to deal with ""elite"" slaves, or even eunuchs, in the same framework of understanding as fieldhands; to uncover previously hidden principles of inheritance of slave and free status; and to show the tight relationship between slavery and freedom.Interdisciplinary in its methods, this study employs qualitative and quantitative techniques from all the social sciences to demonstrate the universality of structures and processes in slave systems and to reveal cross-cultural variations in the slave trade and in slavery, in rates of manumission, and in the status of freedmen. ""Slavery and Social Death"" lays out a vast new corpus of research that underpins an original and provocative thesis.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Race', 'Politics', 'Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'World History', 'Academic']"

Forget Foucault,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211294.Forget_Foucault,"In 1976, Jean Baudrillard sent this essay to the French magazine Critique, where Michel Foucault was an editor. Foucault was asked to reply, but remained silent. Forget Foucault (1977) made Baudrillard instantly infamous in France. It was a devastating revisitation of Foucault's recent History of Sexuality--and of his entire oeuvre--and also an attack on those philosophers, like Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari, who believed that desire could be revolutionary. In Baudrillard's eyes, desire and power were interchangeable, so desire had no place in Foucault's work. There is no better introduction to Baudrillard's polemical approach to culture than these pages, in which Baudrillard dares Foucault to meet the challenge of his own thought. This Semiotext(e) edition of Forget Foucault is accompanied by a dialogue with Sylv?re Lotringer, ""Forget Baudrillard,"" a reevaluation by Baudrillard of his lesser-known early works as a post-Marxian thinker. Lotringer presses Baudrillard to explain how he arrived at his infamous extrapolationist theories from his roots in the nineteenth and early twentieth century social and anthropological works of Karl Marx, Marcel Mauss, and Emil Durkheim.","['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Politics', 'Anthropology']"

She has lived in the village for decades, ever since her husband, an idealistic young doctor, ran afoul of the sultan’s grand vizier and arrived to serve the poor fishermen. Now mostly bedridden, she is attended by her constant servant Recep, a dwarf—and the doctor’s illegitimate son. Despite mutual dependency, there is no love lost between mistress and servant, who have very different recollections—and grievances—from the early years, before Cennethisar grew into a high-class resort surrounding the family house, now in shambles.Though eagerly anticipated, Fatma’s grandchildren bring little consolation. The eldest, Faruk, a dissipated historian, wallows in alcohol as he laments his inability to tell the story of the past from the kaleidoscopic pieces he finds in the local archive; his sensitive leftist sister, Nilgün, has yet to discover the real-life consequences of highminded politics; and Metin, a high school nerd, tries to keep up with the lifestyle of his spoiled society schoolmates while he fantasizes about going to America—an unaffordable dream unless he can persuade his grandmother to tear down her house.But it is Recep’s nephew Hasan, a high school dropout, lately fallen in with right-wing nationalists, who will draw the visiting family into the growing political cataclysm issuing from Turkey’s tumultuous century-long struggle for modernity.By turns deeply moving, hilarious, and terrifying, pulses with the special energy of a great writer’s early work even as it offers beguiling evidence of the mature genius for which Orhan Pamuk would later be celebrated the world over.","['Fiction', 'Turkish Literature', 'Turkish', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Politics']"

""This elegant little book is essential reading for anyone interested in the demise, the terminal silliness, of our culture."" -- John Irving, The New York Times Book Review; ""In this elegant, poignant essay, written with the grace of a master stylist, George Trow articulates the accelerated impermanence of American culture with a precision that is both flaunting and devastating."" -- Rudy Wurlitrer; ""Within the Context of No Context is a masterpiece of the century that belongs on a shelf next to Theodore Adorno's Minima Moralia and Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle."" -- Michael Tolkin; ""Within the Context of No Context may appear to be a book of the mind, for it is suffused with such a keen intelligence, but it is actually a book of the heart -- passionate, brave, and stirring."" -- Sue Halpern.","['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Cultural', 'Journalism', 'History', 'Criticism', 'Politics', 'American']"

Paradise,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400455.Paradise,"Four young women are brutally attacked in a convent near an all-black town in America in the mid-1970s. The inevitability of this attack, and the attempts to avert it, lie at the heart of PARADISE. Spanning the birth of the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, the counter culture and the politics of the late 70s, deftly manipulating past, present and future, this novel of mysterious motives reveals the interior lives of the citizens of the town with astonishing clarity. The drama of its people - from the four young women and their elderly protector, to conservative businessmen, rednecks, a Civil Rights minister and veterans of three wars - richly evokes clashes that have bedevilled American society: between race and racelessness; patriarchy and matriarchy; religion and magic; freedom and belonging; promicuity and fidelity. Magnificent in its scope, PARADISE is a revelation in the intensity of its portrayal of human complexity and in the sheer force of its narrative.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'African American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Feminism', 'Race', 'Contemporary']"

On Bullshit,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385.On_Bullshit,"One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, ""we have no theory.""Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Humor', 'Psychology', 'Politics', 'Language', 'Sociology', 'Cultural', 'Audiobook']"

On his way to work, Pedro worries that a massacre is in the making; an olive-drab truck packed with armed soldiers rumbles by. And then the church bells begin to ring, and there is the relentless voice on the radio everywhere, urging the slaughter of all the Haitians.

The town is in an uproar, Adele is ordered to say ""perejil"" but stammers. And Pedro runs home and searches for his beloved wife, searches and searches "" The characters of this book not only inspired the love and outrage of an extraordinary writer like Philoctete,"" writes Edwige Danticat, ""but continue to challenge the meaning of community and humanity in all of us.""",['Fiction']
A Christmas Story,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5319.A_Christmas_Story,"A beloved, bestselling classic of humorous and nostalgic Americana—the book that inspired the equally classic Yuletide film and the live musical on Fox. The holiday film A Christmas Story, first released in 1983, has become a bona fide Christmas perennial, gaining in stature and fame with each succeeding year. Its affectionate, wacky, and wryly realistic portrayal of an American family’s typical Christmas joys and travails in small-town Depression-era Indiana has entered our imagination and our hearts with a force equal to It’s a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. This edition of A Christmas Story gathers together in one hilarious volume the gems of autobiographical humor that Jean Shepherd drew upon to create this enduring film. Here is young Ralphie Parker’s shocking discovery that his decoder ring is really a device to promote Ovaltine; his mother and father’s pitched battle over the fate of a lascivious leg lamp; the unleashed and unnerving savagery of Ralphie’s duel in the show with the odious bullies Scut Farkas and Grover Dill; and, most crucially, Ralphie’s unstoppable campaign to get Santa—or anyone else—to give him a Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle. Who cares that the whole adult world is telling him, “You’ll shoot your eye out, kid”? The pieces that comprise A Christmas Story, previously published in the larger collections In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash and Wanda Hickey’s Night of Golden Memories, coalesce in a magical fashion to become an irresistible piece of Americana, quite the equal of the film in its ability to warm the heart and tickle the funny bone.","['Christmas', 'Humor', 'Fiction', 'Holiday', 'Classics', 'Short Stories', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Fiction', 'Comedy', 'Biography Memoir']"

The Changing Light at Sandover,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98946.The_Changing_Light_at_Sandover,"James Merrill’s audacious and dazzling epic poem, The Changing Light at Sandover, remains as startling today as when it first emerged in separate volumes over a period of several years. Individual parts won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and the entire poem, when it was collected into one volume in 1982, won the National Book Critics Circle Award. It is now an American classic, here in a definitive new hardcover edition that includes Voices from Sandover, Merrill’s recasting of the poem for the stage. The book carries us to the scene of Merrill’s Ouija board sessions with his partner, David Jackson—the candlelit Stonington dining room with its flame-colored walls and the famous Willowware cup they used as a pointer in their occult travels. In a shimmering interplay of verse forms, Merrill set down their extended conversations with their familiar and guide, Ephraim (a first-century Greek Jew), W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, Plato, a brilliant peacock named Mirabell, and other old friends who had passed to the other side. JM (whom the spirits call “scribe”) and DJ (“hand”) are also introduced to the lonely eminence God B (“God Biology”), his sister Mother Nature, and a host of angels and lesser residents of the empyrean who are variously involved in the ways of this world.The laughter, the missteps, and the schoolroom frustrations of the earthly pair’s gradual enlightenment make this otherworldly journey, finally, and utterly human one. A unique exploration of the writer’s role in a postatomic, postreligious age, Sandover has been compared to the work of Yeats, Proust, Milton, and Blake. Merrill’s tale of the joys and tragedies of man’s powers, and his message about the importance of our endangered efforts to make a good life on earth, will stand as one of the most profound experiences available to readers of poetry.","['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Epic', 'Classics', 'American', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Canon', 'Magic', 'Art']"

His fascination with myth is evident in pieces on Ovid's Metamorphoses and the separate odysseys that make up Homer's Odyssey. Three intertwined essays on French utopian socialist Fourier present him as a precursor of Women's Lib, a satirist and visionary thinker whose scheme for a society in which each person's desires could be satisfied deserves to be taken seriously. In other pieces, Calvino brings a fresh, unpredictable approach to why we should reread the classics, how cinema and comic strips influence writers, and the cartoon universe of Saul Steinberg. His message is that writers need to establish erotic communion with the humdrum objects of everyday reality.","['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Literary Criticism', 'Books About Books', 'Literature', 'Criticism', 'Writing', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Theory']"

Roussel's story, about a master mariner named White who encounters an African chief named Booltable, is built upon the kind of whimsical and extravagant word play (its first and last sentences are identical except for one letter in one word--""pooltable""/ ""Booltable"") for which Roussel was idolized by the French Surrealists. In contrast, as he writes in his Afterword, Padgett's memoir ""grew out of the nagging need to come to grips with the frustrations of being a white American who had grown up in a racist environment and who, despite his rejections of racism at an early age, had rarely felt unselfconscious in the company of a black person."" ""What he leaves us with is a work that is like the perfectly preserved temple of a cult which has disappeared without a trace, or a complicated set of tools whose use cannot be discovered. But even though we may never be able to 'use' [Roussel's] work in the way he hoped, we can still admire its inhuman beauty, and be stirred by a language that seems always on the point of revealing its secret, of pointing the way back to the 'republic of dreams' whose insignia blazed on his forehead""--John Ashbery.",[]

"Black Athena: Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization, Vol. 1: The Fabrication of Ancient Greece, 1785-1985",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/745332.Black_Athena,"Could Greek philosophy be rooted in Egyptian thought? Is it possible that the Pythagorean theory was conceived on the shores of the Nile and the Euphrates rather than in ancient Greece? Could it be that Western civilization was born on the so-called Dark Continent? For almost two centuries, Western scholars have given little credence to the possibility of such scenarios.In Black Athena, an audacious three-volume series that strikes at the heart of today's most heated culture wars, Martin Bernal challenges Eurocentric attitudes by calling into question two of the longest-established explanations for the origins of classical civilization. The Aryan Model, which is current today, claims that Greek culture arose as the result of the conquest from the north by Indo-European speakers, or ""Aryans,"" of the native ""pre-Hellenes."" The Ancient Model, which was maintained in Classical Greece, held that the native population of Greece had initially been civilized by Egyptian and Phoenician colonists and that additional Near Eastern culture had been introduced to Greece by Greeks studying in Egypt and Southwest Asia. Moving beyond these prevailing models, Bernal proposes a Revised Ancient Model, which suggests that classical civilization in fact had deep roots in Afroasiatic cultures.This long-awaited third and final volume of the series is concerned with the linguistic evidence that contradicts the Aryan Model of ancient Greece. Bernal shows how nearly 40 percent of the Greek vocabulary has been plausibly derived from two Afroasiatic languages-Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic. He also reveals how these derivations are not limited to matters of trade, but extended to the sophisticated language of politics, religion, and philosophy. This evidence, according to Bernal, confirms the fact that in Greece an Indo-European people was culturally dominated by speakers of Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic.Provocative, passionate, and colossal in scope, this volume caps a thoughtful rewriting of history that has been stirring academic and political controversy since the publication of the first volume.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Race', 'Classics', 'Ancient History', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Greece', 'European History']"

Forbidden Territory and Realms of Strife: The Memoirs of Juan Goytisolo,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/172151.Forbidden_Territory_and_Realms_of_Strife,"For forty-five years, the expatriate Juan Goytisolo has been widely acknowledged as both Spain’s greatest living writer and its most scabrous critic. In some thirty books of fiction, autobiography, essays and journalism, he has turned the Spanish language against what he derides as ‘Sunnyspain’, flaying the ‘Hispanos’ while excavating their culture’s Moorish and Jewish roots.This, his masterful two-volume autobiography first published in the mid-1980s, broke new ground in Spanish letters with its introspective sexual and emotional honesty. It charts the writer’s unique journey from a Barcelona childhood violently disrupted by the Spanish civil war to student rebellion against the Francoist dictatorship and exile as a ‘self-banished Spaniard’ to Paris in 1956.In Paris, Goytisolo fell in love with Monique Lange, befriended Jean Genet, and discovered his own homosexuality as he supported the struggles for Algerian independence. His passionate, iconoclastic pen spares no one, least of all himself, in this striking portrayal of politics and sexuality in twentieth-century France and Spain.","['Nonfiction', 'Literature']"

Only the realization that her young son needs companions convinces her to take in his two motherless children while he returns to the fight against Napoleon's armies. For the next two years, her only contact with Falk is through his letters, terse messages, but always accompanied by charming stories for the children. She slowly falls in love with the man behind the stories. When now-Major Falk returns for a brief visit before shipping out to North America, she sees nothing of the storyteller in the tired, short-spoken soldier. Concerned over the fate of his children if he should fall in battle, Falk sets up guardianships. An acquaintance, well-intentioned but misguided, mentions him to the half-sister he has not seen for twenty years. Falk is the son of the widowed Duchess of Newsham, but not of the late duke. Never having been declared illegitimate, Richard has some claim on the estate now held by his half-brother. There is ample evidence that attempts on his life have been made in the past, and now he fears for his children's safety. But he is a soldier, and Napoleon is once again loose in Europe, so all he can do is trust Emily, his friend Tom Conway, and his brother-in-law to protect the children. When Richard returns, wounded, from Waterloo, and speaks of emigrating to keep them safe, Emily knows she must speak her mind-and her heart-or lose him forever.","['Romance', 'Regency', 'Historical Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Regency Romance', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Clean Romance', 'Traditional Regency']"
